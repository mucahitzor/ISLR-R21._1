We may want to inquire the following questions:\n\n1.  *Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?*\n\n    First we should determine if there is an association between adveritisng expenditure and sales. If not, no money shpuld be spent on advertising.\n\n2.  *How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?*\n\n    If there is a relationship between advertising and sales, what is the strength of this relationship? Given a certain advertising budget, can we predict sales with a high level of accuracy? =\\> strong relationsihp.\n\n3.  *Which media contribute to sales?*\n\n    Do all variables--tv,radio,newspaper-- contribute to sales, or just one or the two?\n\n4.  *How accurately can we estimate the effect of each medium on sales?*\n\n    For every ollar spent on advertising in a particular medium, by what amount will sales increase? How accuretly can we predict this amount of increase?\n\n5.  *How accurately can we predict future sales?*\n\n    For any given level of media advertisig, what is our prediction for sales, and what is the accuracy of this prediciton?\n\n6.  *Is the relationship linear?*\n\n    If so linear regresion is appropriate tool, if not we may need to transform the predictor or the repsonse so that liner regression can be used.\n\n7.  *Is there synergy among the advertising media?*\n\n    Does the effect of a medium on sales depend on other medium levels? Does dividing advertisement budget to two or three medium yeild a higher sales?\n\nWe can answer each of these questions using Linear regression.\n\n## Simple Linear Regression\n\nPredicting a quantitative response $Y$ on the basis of a single predictor variable $X$.\n\nOur assumption is that there is approximately a linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$; we can write this linear relationship as\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n$$\nY \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\n$$ (3.1)\n\nFor example lets say $X$ is `TV`, and $Y$ is `sales`\n\n$$\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV + \\epsilon\n$$ or\n\n$$\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV\n$$\n\nOn (3.1) $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are unknown constants that represent the *intercept* and *slope* in the linear model. Together they are known as *coefficients* or *parameters*.\n\nWe are going to use or training data to produce estimates for $\\beta_0$ =\\> $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\beta_1$ =\\> $\\hat{\\beta_1}$. Using these predicted coefficients we can predict sales;\n\n$$\n\\hat{sales} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\times TV\n$$\n\nor as in general form\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x\n$$ (3.2)\n\n### Estimating the coefficients\n\nSince, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are unknown, before we can use (3.1) to make predictions we must use data to estimate the coefficients. We have $n$ observations :\n\n$$\n(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \\dots, (x_n,y_n)\n$$\n\nWe want our estimated coefficients to give such predictions that will fit the avaible data as well =\\> $y_i \\approx \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i$ for $i = 1,\\dots, n$. This coefficients will allow us to draw a regression line and we want this regression line to be close as possible to the $n$ data points we have.\n\nThere are different ways to measure *closeness*. The most common approach is minimizing the *least squares* criterion. Alternative approaches will be considered in Chapter 6.\n\nOur predictions come from $\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i$.\n\nThen for each data we have a *residual*: difference between $y$ and $\\hat{y}$:\n\n$$\ne_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i}\n$$\n\nWe need to take the squares to get the distances--because of the negative residuals, and sum them to get the *residual sum of squares*(RSS)\n\n$$\nRSS = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_n^2\n$$\n\nthis is equal to\n\n$$\nRSS = (y_i - \\hat{beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1)^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_2) + \\dots + (y_n - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_n)\n$$ (3.3)\n\nThe least squares approach chooses $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ to minimize RSS. These minimizers are\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\beta_1} &= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\\n\\hat{\\beta_0} &= \\bar{y_i} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x}\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.4)\n\n$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$ and $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$ are the sample means.\n\nSo (3.4) defines the *least squares coefficient estimates* for simple linear regression.\n\nLets calculate them with R\n\n```{r}\nbeta_1_hat_adv = sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV)) * ((advertising$sales - mean(advertising$sales)))) / sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV))^2)\nbeta_1_hat_adv\n```\n\nSo; our \\$\\hat{\\beta_1} = 0.0475 \\$\n\n```{r}\nbeta_0_hat_adv = mean(advertising$sales) - beta_1_hat_adv * mean(advertising$TV)\nbeta_0_hat_adv\n```\n\nour $\\hat{\\beta_0} = 7.032$\n\nLets compare them with r function\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, data = advertising))\n```\n\nCalculating the predicted values\n\n```{r}\ny_hat_adv = beta_0_hat_adv + beta_1_hat_adv * advertising$TV\ny_hat_adv[1:10]\n```\n\nOur $y_i$ values are as above.\n\n```{r}\nRSS = sum((advertising$sales - y_hat_adv)^2)\nRSS\n```\n\nOur $\\text{RSS} = 2102.531$\n\nSo we can draw our regression line\n\n```{r fig.width=10}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| fig-cap: For the advertising data, the least squares fit for the regression of sales onto TV. The fit is found by minimizing the sum of squared errors. Each grey line segment represents an error, adn the fit make a comprimise by averaging their squares. In this case a linear fit captures the essence of the relationship, although it is somewhat deficient in the left of the plot\nadvertising %>%\n  ggplot() + aes(x=TV, y = sales) +  geom_abline(intercept = beta_0_hat_adv, slope = beta_1_hat_adv, color = \"#262B70\", size =1.2) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend=TV, yend=y_hat_adv), color = \"#939393\") +\n  geom_point(color = \"#AA1D2E\", size =2) + theme_par()\n```\n\nSo we have\n\n$$\n\\hat{y_i} = 7.032 + 0.0475x_i\n$$\n\nAccording to this approximation an additional \\$1,000 spent on TV increases sales by 47.5 units.\n\n### Assessing the Accuracy of the Coefficient Estimates\n\nWe assumed that *true* relationship is linear: $Y = f(X) + \\epsilon$. We don't know $f$, and $\\epsilon$ is a mean-zero random error term.\n\nWe said $f$ is approximatly linear, so that $f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$; which means\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\n$$ (3.5)\n\nerror term captures: \\* the true relationship may not be linear \\* other variables that affect Y \\* measurement error\n\nand is independent of $X$.\n\n(3.5) is the *population regression line*: the best linar approximation to the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$.\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}X\n$$ is the *least squares line*. They are different of course! But we don't know the population regression line. If we did:\n\nFor example, lets create a data;\n\n-   First we create random x values from 100 random numbers\n\n```{r}\nseq(-2,2,length.out=100)[1:10]\n```\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(11)\nx = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\nx[1:10]\n```\n\nlets define our $f$--population parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$\n\n$$\nf(X) = 2 + 3\\times X\n$$ Now lets create our $Y$ values from this function but we also want to add random error values as well\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(11)\ny = 2 + 3*x + rnorm(100)\ny[1:10]\n```\n\nSo we have a data set\n\n```{r}\ndata = tibble(\n  y = y, x = x\n)\n```\n\nNow lets plot this data points\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=x, y=y) + geom_point() \n```\n\nNow, even though we already know $f$ and population parameters $\\beta_0 = 2$ and $\\beta_1 = 3$, lets estimate them:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(y ~ x, data = data))\n```\n\nSo our *least squares estimation is*\n\n$$\n\\hat{y_i} = 1.88 + 3.06 x_i\n$$ Lets draw this *least squares regression line to our plot*\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=x, y=y) + geom_point() + geom_abline(intercept=1.88, slope = 3.06, size = 1.2) + theme_par()\n```\n\nWhat about the population regression line\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=x, y=y) + geom_point() + geom_abline(intercept = 1.9, slope = 3.06, size = 1.2) + geom_abline(intercept = 2, slope = 3, color =\"red\") + theme_par()\n```\n\nThey are not the same! If we were to have another data from the same data generation process other estimates of parameters would result with different *least squares regression lines*:\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(111)\nx_r1 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r1 = 2 + 3*x_r1 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(1111)\nx_r2 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r2 = 2 + 3*x_r2 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(11111)\nx_r3 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r3 = 2 + 3*x_r3 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(111111)\nx_r4 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r4 = 2 + 3*x_r4 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(1111111)\nx_r5 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r5 = 2 + 3*x_r5 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(11111111)\nx_r6 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r6 = 2 + 3*x_r6 + rnorm(100)\n```\n\nLets now estimate population parameters for each of these data and plot them\n\n```{r}\ndata_r = tibble(\n  y_r1,x_r1,y_r2,x_r2,y_r3,x_r3,y_r4,x_r4, y_r5,x_r5,y_r6,x_r6\n)\ndata_r\n```\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x,y) + geom_point(size = 0, color = \"white\")  + \n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r1 ~ x_r1)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r1 ~ x_r1)$coefficients[2], color =\"#29019F\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r2 ~ x_r2)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r2 ~ x_r2)$coefficients[2], color =\"#0A04BF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r3 ~ x_r3)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r3 ~ x_r3)$coefficients[2], color =\"#0930DF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r4 ~ x_r4)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r4 ~ x_r4)$coefficients[2], color =\"#0E6DFF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r5 ~ x_r5)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r5 ~ x_r5)$coefficients[2], color =\"#2BA8FF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r6 ~ x_r6)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r6 ~ x_r6)$coefficients[2], color =\"#48D9FF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept =2, slope =3, color = \"red\") +\n  \n  theme_par()\n```\n\nSo, different data sets generated from the same true model result in slightly different least squares lines, but the unobserved population regression line does not change.\n\nThis is because we are using a sample, and estimating characteristics of the population. Usually these characteristics are different, but generally sample characteristics will provide a good estimate to the population characteristics.\n\nComputing $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ from different sets of sample data provide different but similar results. And we are trying to estimate population parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ with these. Some of these $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ will overestimate, some will underestimate $\\beta_0$, and $\\beta_1$. But if we could average all these estimated parameters and take the average, than this average should be equal to population parameters; if this is the case this estimator is called *unbiased estimator*. So an unbiased estimator does not *systematically* over- or under-estimate the true parameter.\n\nOkay but how close $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ are to the true values $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. We want to compute the standard errors associated with $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$. Standard error telss us the average amount of estimate differes from the actual value.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0})^2 &= \\sigma^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x}^2)}\\right] \\\\\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})^2 &= \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.8)\n\nWhere $\\sigma^2=\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)$.\n\nNotice that formula of $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ is smaller when $x_i$ are more spread out; intutively we have more *leverage* to estimate a slope when this is the case.\n\nIn general $\\sigma^2$ is not known, but can be estimated from the data. The estimate of $\\sigma$ is known as the *residual standard error*, and given by the formula\n\n$$\n\\text{RSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{RSS}/(n-2)}\n$$ So, when $\\sigma^2$ is estimated fro mthe data we should write $\\hat{\\text{SE}}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ to indicate that an estimate has been made, but usually we drop this extra hat.\n\nStandard errors can be used to compute *confidence intervals*. A 95% confidence interval is defines as a range of values such that with 95% probability, the rage will contain the true unknown value of the parameter. The range is defined in terms of lower and upper limits computed from the sample of data. For linear regression, the 95% confidence interval for $\\beta_1$ approximately takes the form\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta_1} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}) \n$$ (3.9)\n\nSo there is approximately a 95% chance that the interval $$[\\hat{\\beta_1} - 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}), \\hat{\\beta_1} + 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta-1})]$$ (3.10) will contain the true value of $\\beta_1$. Same is true for $\\beta_0$\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta_0} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0})\n$$ (3.11)\n\nLets calculate the confidence intervals for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ from our original data and model\n\n$$\n\\hat{sales_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}\\cdot TV\n$$ We first need to calculate RSS and RSE:\n\n$$\n\\text{RSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\n$$\n\n```{r}\nRSS = sum((advertising$sales - y_hat_adv)^2)\nRSS\n```\n\n$$\n\\text{RSE} = \\sigma = \\sqrt{RSS/(n-2)}\n$$\n\n```{r}\nRSE = sqrt((RSS / (length(advertising$sales) -2)))\nRSE\n```\n\nFor $\\beta_0$\n\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0}) = \\sigma^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\right]\n$$\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_0_adv =  sqrt(RSE^2 * (1/length(advertising$sales) + (mean(advertising$TV)^2 / sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV))^2))))\nse_beta_0_adv\n```\n\nSo we can calculate the confidence interval for $\\beta_0$\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"In the absence of any advertising, sales will on average, fall somewhere between\",beta_0_hat_adv - 1.96 * se_beta_0_adv, \"and\", beta_0_hat_adv + 1.96 * se_beta_0_adv)\n```\n\nFor $\\hat{\\beta_1}$:\n\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})^2 =\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n$$\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_1_adv = sqrt(RSE^2 / (sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV))^2)))\nse_beta_1_adv\n```\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"For each $1,000 increase in TV advertising, average increase in sales will be between\",(beta_1_hat_adv - 1.96 * se_beta_1_adv) * 1000, \"and\", (beta_1_hat_adv + 1.96 * se_beta_1_adv)*1000, \"by 95% confidence\")\n```\n\nLets confirm our results\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nconfint(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\nSo standard errors of our estimated parameters tells us the average amount of difference from the true population parameters. And using the confidence intervals we can tell a range of the true population parameters' interval with a percentage (usually 95%).\n\nLets do this for our `data` as well, which we know has the form\n\n$$\ny_i = 2 + 3 x_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$ Lets calculate $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ first\n\n```{r}\nbeta_1_hat_data = sum((data$x - mean(data$x)) * (data$y - mean(data$y))) / sum((data$x - mean(data$x))^2)\nbeta_1_hat_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nbeta_0_hat_data = mean(data$y) - beta_1_hat_data * mean(data$x)\nbeta_0_hat_data\n```\n\n$$\n\\hat{y_i} = 1.88 + 3.05 x_i\n$$\n\nlets confirm this\n\n```{r}\nlm(y~x, data)\n```\n\nLets calculate the residual sum of squares, residual sum of errors, standard errors, and confidence intervals\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  mutate(\n    y_hat = beta_0_hat_data + beta_1_hat_data * x\n  ) -> data\n\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSS_data = sum((data$y - data$y_hat)^2)\nRSS_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSE_data = sqrt((RSS_data/(length(data$y) -2)))\nRSE_data\n```\n\nso $\\sigma_{data} = 0.9163$\n\nWe can now compute the standard errors of estiamed coefficients\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_0_data = sqrt(((1/length(data$y)) + (mean(data$x)^2 / sum((data$x - mean(data$x))^2))) * RSE_data^2)\nse_beta_0_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_1_data = sqrt(RSE_data^2 / (sum((data$x - mean(data$x))^2)))\nse_beta_1_data\n```\n\nLets confirm\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(y~x,data))\n```\n\nSo we can say that on average our $\\hat{\\beta_0}$s are 0.091 differ from $\\beta_0$, and our $\\hat{\\beta_1}$s differ 0.076 from $\\beta_1$. To make more sense of it we can calculate the confidence intervals\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"By 95% confidence we can say that the true beta_0 is between\", beta_0_hat_data - 1.96 * se_beta_0_data, \"and\", beta_0_hat_data + 1.96 * se_beta_0_data )\n```\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"By 95% confidence we can say that the true beta_0 is between\", beta_1_hat_data - 1.96 * se_beta_1_data, \"and\", beta_1_hat_data + 1.96 * se_beta_1_data)\n```\n\nLets confirm this\n\n```{r}\nconfint(lm(y~x,data))\n```\n\nLets plot this confidence interval\n\n```{r}\nlm(y~x,data) %>% \n  dwplot(ci = 0.95,dot_args = list(size=2), vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"grey50\", linetype =2))\n```\n\nSince standard error tells us the range of the $\\beta$ values via confidence interval, we can infer that if this range does not include 0, than our $\\beta$ values are statistically significant; x is assocaited with y.\n\n\nLets do this for `advertising` data as well\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: the 95% confidence interval does not include 0; TV is statistically significant\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  tidy() %>% \n  dwplot(ci = 0.95,dot_args = list(size=2), vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"grey50\", linetype =2))\n```\n\nOr we can use standard erros to perform *hypothesis tests* on the coefficients. We usually don't care about the intercept, so lets do the hypothesis test on only $\\hat{\\beta_1}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nH_0 &: \\beta_1 = 0 \\to \\text{there is no relationship between X and Y} \\\\\nH_1 &: \\beta_1 \\neq 0 \\to \\text{there is some relationship between X and Y}\n\\end{align}\n$$ \nIf the *null-hypothesis* is true =\\> \\$ \\beta\\_1 = 0\\$ =\\> $Y = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon$ =\\> $X$ is not associated with $Y$.\n\nTo test the null-hypothessi, we need to determine whether our estimate $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is sufficiently far from zero that we can be confident that $\\beta_1$ is non-zero. How far is enough? This depends on the accuracy of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$--that is it depends on $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$. If $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ is small, then even relatively small values of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ may provide strong evidence that $\\beta_1 \\neq 0$. If $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ is large, then $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ must be large in absolute value in order for us to reject the null hypothessis. In practice we compute a *t-statistic* given by\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_1} - 0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})}\n$$ (3.14)\n\nwhich measures the number of standard deviations that $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is away from zero. From the t-statistic we can compute the *p-value*; a small p value indicates that it is unlikely to observe such a substantial association between the predictor and the response due to chance, in absence of any real association between the predictor and the response. So if p value is small we infer that there is assocaition between the predictor and the response =\\> we reject the null hypothesis. Typical p-value cutoffs for rejecting the null hypothesis are 5 or 1%. When $n=30$ these correspond to tstatsitcs of around 2 and 2.75.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales~TV,advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  confint() %>% \n  kableExtra::kable(format = \"latex\")\n\n```\n\nHere we see that t statistics are very high, and p values are very low =\\> reject the null hypothesis for both $\\beta$ values; they are statistically significant.\n\n### Assessing the Accuracy of the Model\n\nOnce we concluded the statistically significant variable--rejecting the null hypothesis, we want to quantify *the extend to which the model fits the data*. We can use either\n\n-   *Residual standard error*\n-   $R^2$\n\n*Residual standard error*\n\nRecall from $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i$ that associated with each observation is an error term $\\epsilon$. Because of these error terms even if we knew the true regression line, we would not be able to predict $Y$ from $X$. The *RSE* is an estimate of the standard deviation of $\\epsilon$. It is the average amount that the response will deviate from the true regression line, computed by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{RSE} &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\text{RSS}} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.15)\n\nIn the advertising data, RSE was 3.26; actual sales in each market deviate from the true regression line by approximately 3,269 units, on average. This also means that; if the model were correct and the true values of the unknown coefficients $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ were known exaclty, any predcition of sales on the basis of TV advertising would still be off by about 3,260 units on average. Is this prediction error accaptable? Depends on the data: in the `advertising` data set the mean value of `sales` is $\\approx 14,000$ units, and so the percentage error is $3,260 / 14,000 = 23%$.\n\nThe RSE is considered a measure of the *lack of fit* of the model $Y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon$ to the data. If the predictions from the model are very close to the true outcome values--$\\hat{y_i} \\approx y_i$ then RSE will be small, and we can concldue that the model fits the data very well. Otherwise, if $\\hat{y_i}$ is very far from $y_i$ then RSE may be quite large, indicating the model doesn't fit the data well.\n\n$R^2$**Statistic**\n\nThe RSE provides an absolute measure of lack of fit of the model to the data. $R^2$ provides an alternative measure of fit. It takes the form of a *proportion*--the proportion of variance explained--and so its always $0\\leq R^2 \\leq 1$ and is independent of the scale of $Y$--as opposed to RSE.\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{TSS - RSS}{TSS} = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS}\n$$ (3.17)\n\nwhere $\\text{TSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ is the *total sun of squares* and $\\text{RSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$. TSS measures the total variaance in the response $Y$; and can be thought of as the amount of varaiblity ingerent in the response before the regression is performed. RSS measures the amount of varaiblity that is left unexplained after performing the regression. So TSS - RSS measures the amount of variability in the response that is explained by performing the regression, and $R^2$ measures the *proportion of variability in* $Y$ *that can be explained using* $X$. As $R^2$ gets closer to 1, a large proportion of the variability in the response has been explained by the regression. A number near 0 indicates that the regression did not explain much of the variablity in the response; this might occur because the linear model is wrong, or the inherit error $\\sigma^2 = \\text{RSE}^2$ is high, or both.\n\nLets calculate $R^2$ of our estimation on `advertising` data with the model $\\hat{sales_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}TV_i$\n\n```{r}\nadvertising %>% \n  mutate(sales_hat = beta_0_hat_adv + beta_1_hat_adv * TV) -> advertising\nadvertising\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSS = sum((advertising$sales - advertising$sales_hat)^2)\nRSS\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSE = sqrt(RSS/(length(advertising$sales) -2))\nRSE\n```\n\n```{r}\nTSS = sum((advertising$sales - mean(advertising$sales))^2)\nTSS\n```\n\n```{r}\nR2 = (TSS - RSS) / TSS\nR2\n```\n\n61% of the variablity in `sales` is explained by a linear regression on `TV`.\n\nwhat about our `data`\n\n```{r}\ndata\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSS_data = sum((data$y - data$y_hat)^2)\nRSS_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSE_data = sqrt(RSS_data/(length(data$y) -2))\nRSE_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nTSS_data = sum((data$y - mean(data$y))^2)\nTSS_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nR2_data = (TSS_data - RSS_data) / TSS_data\nR2_data\n```\n\n94% of the variablity in `y` is explained by `x`; very good fit of the model.\n\n$R^2$ is better to interpret than RSE.\n\n## Multiple Linear Regression\n\nIn practice we have more than one predictor to explain $Y$.\n\nHow can we extend our analysis of the advertising order to accomodate the other two (`radio` and `newspaper`) additional predictors?\n\n=\\> We can run three separate simple linear regressions, each of which uses a different advertising medium as a predictor:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ radio, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nWe find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on radio advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 203 units.\n\nWe find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on newspaper advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 55 units.\n\nWe find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on TV advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 47 units.\n\n**However** this approach is not good. First of all it is unclear to make a sinlge prediction of sales given levesl of the three advertising media budgets, since each has their own regression equation. Second, each of these three regression equations ignores the other two medi in forming estimates for the regression coefficients. Especially if these media budgets are correalted, this can lead to very misleading estimates of the individaul media effects on sales.\n\nInstead of the seperate linear regressions for each predictor, better approach is to extend the simple linear regression setting $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$ to\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n(3.19)\n\nHere we interpret $B_j$ as the average effect of a one unit increase in $X_j$, *holding all other predictors fixed*.\n\nFor the advertising example;\n\n$$\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TV + \\beta_2 radio + \\beta_3 newspaper + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n### Estimating the Regression Coefficients\n\nAgain, regression coefficients in (3.19) are unknown, and must be estimated from the data. And with these estimates we can make predictions\n\n$$\n\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\hat{\\beta_2}x_2 + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta_p}x_p\n$$ (3.21)\n\nThe parameters are estimated using the same least squares approach with simple linear regression. We choose $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p$ to minimize the sum of squared residuals\n\n\\$\\$ \\begin{align}\n\n\\text{RSS} &= \\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_{i1} - \\beta_2x_{i2} - \\dots - \\beta_px_{ip})^2\n\n\\end{align} \\$\\$ (3.22)\n\n$\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1},\\dots, \\hat{\\beta_p}$ values minimize RSS.\n\nWe are not going to calculate these estimates with our hands, R does that.\n\nLets see our model results with the three predictors.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\n*Interpretation:* for a given amount of Tv and newspaper advertising, spending additional \\$1,000 on radio(TV)(newspaper) advertising leads to an increase in sales approximately by 189(46)(-1) units.\n\nIf we compare these effects with one predictor regressions\n\n> We find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on radio advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 203 units.\n\n> We find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on newspaper advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 55 units.\n\n> We find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on TV advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 47 units.\n\nFor tv and radio coefficients are similar, but for **newspaper**: from the simple linear regression coefficient of newspaper was significant, but in multiple linear regression it is not; p value is very high.\n\n```{r}\nconfint(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nIts confidence interval contains 0.\n\nThis difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression coefficients stems from the fact that in the simple regression, the slope term represents the average effet of a one dollar increase in newspaper advertising, ignoring other preditors such as tv and radio. In contrsat, in the multiple regression setting, the coefficient for newspaper represents the average effect of increeasing newapper spending by one dollar, while holding tv and radio fixed.\n\nDoes it make sense for the multiple regression to suggest no relationship between sales and newspaper while the simple linear regression implies the opposite? Yes!\n\nTake a look at this correlation matrix:\n\n```{r}\ncor(advertising[1:4])\n```\n\nWe can also make it a plot out of this:\n\n```{r}\ncorrplot(cor(advertising[1:4]), method = \"number\")\n```\n\nNotice that correlation between radio and newspaper is 0.35. This reveals a tendency to spend more on newspaper advertising in markets where more is spent on radio advertising. Now suppose the multiple regression is correct and newspaper advertising has no direct impact on sales, but radio advertising does increase sales. Then in markets where we spend more on radio, our sales will tend to be higher, adn as our correaltion matrix shows, we also tend to spend more on newspaper advertising in those same markets. Hence, in a simple linaer regresion which only examines sales vs newspaper, we will observe that higher values of newspaper tend to be associated with higher values of sales, even though newspaper advertising does not actually affect sales. So newspaper sales are proxy for radio advertising; newspaper gets credit for the effect of radio on sales.\n\nThis is a very common issue. Consider running a regression of shark attack versus ice cream sales for data collected at a given beach community. We would see a positive relationship, similar to that seen between sales and newspaper. Of course ice creams doesnt cause shark attacks. In reality higher temperatures cause more people to visit the beach in trun results in more ice cream sales and more shark attacks. A multiple regression of attacks versus ice cream sales and temperature revals that, the former predictr is no longer significant after adjusting for temperature.\n\n### Some important Questions\n\nWhen we perform MLR, we usually are interested answering a few important questions\n\n1.  *Is at least one of the predictors* $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p$ *useful in predicting the response?*\n\n2.  *Do all predictors help to explain* $Y$, *or is only a subset of the predictors useful?*\n\n3.  *How well does the model fit the data?*\n\n4 *Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict, and how accurate is our prediction?*\n\nLets answer these questions:\n\n1.  *Is at least one of the predictors* $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p$ *useful in predicting the response?*\n\n    In SLR we simply checked whether $\\beta_1 = 0$ or not. In MLR, we need to ask whether all of the regression coefficients are zero $\\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\dots = \\beta_p = 0$. So our null hypothesis is\n\n    $$\n     \\begin{align}\n     H_0 &: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\dots = \\beta_o = 0 \\\\\n     H_\\alpha &: \\text{at least one} \\space B_j \\space \\text{is non-zero}\n     \\end{align}\n     $$ This hypothesis test is performed by computing the *F-statistic*,\n\n    $$\n     F = \\frac{(TSS - RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\n     $$ (3.23)\n\n    So, if there is no relationship between the resposne and predictors, we expect F-statistic to take on value close to 1. if $H_\\alpha$ is true then $F$ should be greater than 1.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nF statistic is 570 and is far from 1. But it is best to have a look at the p-value of the F statistic which is also very small.\n\nThis means that at least one of the media is associated with increase sales.\n\nIn (3.23) we are testing $H_0$ that all the coefficients are zero. Sometimes we want to test that a particular subset of $q$ of the coefficients are zero. This corresponesd to a null hypothesis\n\n$$\n  H_0 : \\beta_{p-q+1} = \\beta_{p-q+2} = \\dots = \\beta_p\n  $$\n\nIn this case we fit a second model that uses all the variables *except* those last $q$. suppose that residual sum of squares for that model is $RSS_0$. Then the appropriate F-statistic is\n\n$$\n  F = \\frac{(RSS_0 - RSS)/q}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\n  $$ (3.24)\n\nOn advertising MLR we saw that newspaper is not significant from its p value. Then why do we need to look at the overall F-statistic? after all, it seems likely that if any one of the p-values for the individual variables is very small, then *at least one of the predictors is realted to the respose*. This is not true usually, especially when $p$ is large.\n\nSo after estimating the model first look at the F-statistic, than to the individual t statistic p values.\n\n2.  *Do all predictors help to explain* $Y$, *or is only a subset of the predictors useful?* =\\> **Deciding on important variables**\n\n    After lookig at the F statistic, we can look at the individual p values. But if \\*p\\$ is large, we are going to make false discoveries.\n\n    Usually not all predictors are associated with the response. This task of determining which predictors are associated with the response in order to fit a single model involving only those predictors is refered to as *variable selection*. Check out Chapter 6 for more detail. But here is a breif outline of some of the classical approaches.\n\n    Ideally we want to perform variable selection by trying out a lot of different models, each containing different subset of the predictors. For instance if our $p=2$ then we can consider four models\n\n    -   \n\n        (1) a model containing no variables\n\n    -   \n\n        (2) a model containing $x_1$ only\n\n    -   \n\n        (3) a model containnig $x_2$ only\n\n    -   \n\n        (4) a model containing $x1$ and $x_2$.\n\n    We can then select the *best* model out of all the models by looking at some statistics we can use to judge the quality of the model. These are\n\n    -   *Mallow*'s $C_p$\n    -   *Akaike information creterion* (AIC)\n    -   *Bayesian information criterion*(BIC)\n    -   *adjusted* $R^2$\n\n    These are discussed in more detail in chapter 6.\n\n    We can also determine which model is the best by plotting various model outputs, such as the residuals, in order to search for patterns.\n\n    But we cannot consider all models, especially when $p$ is high. There are three classical approaches for this task:\n\n    -   *Forward selection*\n        -   begin with *null model* a model that contains an intercept but no predictors.\n\n        -   Then fit *p* simple linear regressions and add to the null model the variable that results in the lowest RSS.\n\n        -   Then add to that model the variable that results in the lowest RSS for the new two-variable model. This approach is continued until some stopping rule is satisfied.\n    -   *Backward selection*\n        -   Put all varaibles in the model.\n        -   remove the least statistically significant predictor.\n        -   estimate the new regression with $p-1$ variable, remove the largest p-value predictor. This procedure continues until a stopping rule is reached =\\> stop after all remaining variables have p value \\< 0.02\n    -   *Mixed selection*\n        -   Combination of forward selection and backward selection\n        -   Start with no variables in the model\n        -   add the varaible that provides the best fit\n        -   add varaibles one-by-one\n        -   at one point if the p-value for one of the variables in the model rises above a certain treshold, then we remove that variabel from the model.\n        -   Continue untill all variables have sufficiently low p value, and all vairables in the model woudl have a large p-value if added to the model\n\n    Backwar slecetion cannot be used if $p>n$, forward selection can always be used.\n\n3.  *How well does the model fit the data?* **Model Fit**\n\nTwo of the most common numerical measures of model fit are RSE and $R^2$.\n\nIn SLR $R^2$ is equal to $cor(Y,X)$. In MLR $R^2 = cor(Y,\\hat{Y})$.\n\n$R^2$ will always increase as you add more variable, even though that varaible is not statistically significant. This is because adding another variable must allow us to fit the trainig data(not necessarly test data) more accurately. But this increase in $R^2$ after adding a statistically not-significant varible is very low =\\> evidence that you can drop the not significant variable. Check out the $R^2$ variables of the following models\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising))\n```\n\nThey are almost the same.\n\nBut lets see the $R^2$ of the model containing only Tv\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\nit is 0.611.\n\nIf we add radio\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising))\n```\n\nIt increaes dramatically. This implies that model that uses TV and radio to predict sales is better than only using Tv. also radio is statistically signifiacnt.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nNot with newspaper though.\n\nOr the opposite\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ radio, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales~radio+TV, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nWhat about RSE:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nadding newspaper increased the RSE =\\> no need to add newspaper. Adding newspaper increases RSE because\n\n$$\nRSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-p-1}RSS}\n$$\n\nModels with more variables can have higher RSE if the decrease in RSS is small relative to the increase in $p$.\n\nSo we can look at both the RSE and $R^2$.\n\n**Four: Predictions**\n\nAfter fitting the model we can predict $Y$ =\\> $\\hat{y}$ with estimated coefficients. However, there are three sorts of uncertainty associated with this prediction:\n\n1.  The coefficient esstimates $\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1},\\dots,\\hat{\\beta_p}$ are estimates for $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p$:\n\n    That is, the *least squares plane*\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\dots +  \\hat{\\beta_p}x_p\n$$\n\nwhich is only an estimate for the *true population regression plane* $$\nf(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\n$$\n\nSo there is an inaccuracy in the coefficient estimates =\\> this is the *reducible error* from Chapter 2. We can compute a *confidence interval* to determine how close $\\hat{y}$ will be to $f(X)$.\n\n2.  Assuming a linear model for $f(X)$ is almost always an aaproximation of reality (usually relationships are not linear), so ther is an additional source of potentially reducible error =\\> this is the *model bias*.\n\n    When we are using a linear model, we are in fact estimating the best linear approximation to the true surface. However, we will ignore this discrepancy and operate as if the linear model is correct\n\n3.  Even if we knew $f(X)$--that is even if we knew the true values of $\\beta$--the response value cannot be predicted perfectly because of the random error $\\epsilon$ in the model =\\> *irreducable error*. How much will $Y$ vary from $\\hat{y}$ =\\> we use *prediction intervals* to answer this question.\n\n    Predicion intervals are always wider than confidence intervals, because they contain both the *reducible error*(error from estimating coefficients of $f(X)$) and irreducible error.\n\nWe use a *confidence interval* to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the *average* `sales` over a large number of cities. For example given that \\$100,000 is spent on `TV` advertising and \\$20,000 is spent on `radio` advertising in each city, the 95% confidence interval is $[10,985, 11,528]$. We interpret this to mean that 95% of intervals of this form will contain the true value of $f(X)$.\n\nOn the other hand, *a prediction interval* can be used to quantify the uncertainty surrounding `sales` for a *particular* city. Given that \\$100,000 is spent on `TV` advertising and \\$20,000 is spent on `radio` advertising in that city the 95% prediction interval is $[7,930, 14,580]$. We interpret this to mean that 95% of intervals of this form will contain the true value of $Y$ for this city. Note that both intervals are centered at 11,256, but that the prediction intervaş is substantially wider than the confidence interval, reflecting the increased uncertainty about `sales` for a given city in comparison to the average `sales` over many locations.\n\n## Other Considerations in the Regression Model\n\n### Qualitative Predictors\n\nIn practice not all variables are *quantitative*; some predictors are *qualitative*.\n\nCheck out the `Credit` data set\n\n```{r}\nCredit = read.csv(\"./data/Credit.csv\") %>% as_tibble\nCredit\n```\n\nLets do a scatterplot of all variables\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Fig 3.6 The credit data set contains infortmation about blaance, age, cards, education income, limit and rating for a number of potential customers\nCredit %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% pairs(.)\n```\n\n**Predictors with Only Two Levels**\n\nWe want to investigate differences in credit card balance between maels and females, ignoring other variables for the moment. If a qualitative predictors (also known as *factor*) only has two *levels*, then incorporating it into a regression model is very simple. We create a *dummy variable* that takes on two possible *numerical* values. For example based on `Gender` varaible, we can create a new varaible that takes the form\n\n$$\nx_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is female} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is male}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.26)\n\nand use this variable as a predictor in the regression equation. This results in the model\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is female} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i & i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is male}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.27)\n\nNow $\\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the average credit card balance among males, $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ as the average credit card among females, and $\\beta_1$ as the average difference in credit card balance between females and males.\n\nHere is the regression results:\n\n```{r}\nCredit$Gender <- factor(Credit$Gender, levels = c(\" Male\",\"Female\"))\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Gender, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nR converts all *\"Female\"* values to 1 automatically. If we were to do this manually\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  mutate(Gender = as.character(Gender)) %>% \n  mutate(Gender = ifelse(Gender == \"Female\",1,0)) %>% \n  lm(Balance ~ Gender, .) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThis means that average credit card debt for males is estimated to be \\$509.80, whereas females are estimated to carry \\$19.73 in additional debt for a total of $\\$509.80 + \\$19.73 = \\$529.53$. However, the coefficient of the dummy variable is not significant; there is no statistical evidence of a difference in average credit card balance between the genders.\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=Gender, y =Balance, fill = Gender) + geom_boxplot(show.legend = F) + geom_point(data =(Credit %>% group_by(Gender) %>% summarise(Balance = mean(Balance))),shape = 4, show.legend = F) + theme_clean()\n```\n\nThe desicion to code females as 1 and males as 0 in (3.27) is arbitrary, and has no effect on the regression fit, but does alter the interpretation of the coefficients. If we had coded males as 1 and females as 0:\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  mutate(Gender = factor(Gender, levels = c(\"Female\", \" Male\"))) %>% \n  lm(Balance ~ Gender,.) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThen we would say that estimated average debt for females is \\$529.54, and for males is $\\$529.52 - \\$19.73 = \\$509.80$.\n\nAlternatively, instead of 0/1 coding scheme, we could create a dummy variable\n\n$$\nx_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is female} \\\\\n-1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is male}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ and use this variable in the regression equation. This results in the model\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is female} \\\\\n\\beta_0 - \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is male} \n\\end{cases}\n$$ Now $\\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the overall average credit card balance (ignoring the gender effect), and $\\beta_1$ is the amount that females are above the average and males are below the average.\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  mutate(Gender = as.character(Gender)) %>% \n  mutate(Gender = ifelse(Gender == \"Female\",1,-1)) %>% \n  lm(Balance ~ Gender,.) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nNow $\\beta_0$ is \\$ 519.670 which is the halfway between the male and female averages of \\$509.80 and \\$529.53. The estimate for $\\beta_1$ is \\$9.865, which is half of \\$19.74, the average difference between females and males.\n\n**Qualitative Predictors with More than Two levels**\n\nIn this case we need to create an additional dummy. For example have a look at the `Ethnicity` variable\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% select(Ethnicity) %>% unique()\n```\n\nHas three possible values. Then we need to create two dummies\n\n$$\nx_{i1} = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Asian} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is not Asian} \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nx_{i2} = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Caucasian} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is not Caucasian} \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThen both these varaibles can be used in the regression equation, in order to obtain the model\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\beta_2x_{i2} + \\epsilon_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Asian} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Caucasian} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is African American} \n\\end{cases}\n$$ Now $\\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the average credit card balance for African Americans, $\\beta_1$ can be interpreted as the difference in the average balance between Asian and African american categories, and $\\beta_2$ can be interpreted as the difference in average balance between the Caucasian and African American categories.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Ethnicity, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThere will always be one fewer dummy variable than the number of levels. The level with no dummy variable--African American in this example--is known as the *baseline*.\n\nFrom the regression results we see that the estimated `balance` for the baseline, African American, is \\$531.00. It is estimated that Asian category will have \\$18.69 less debt than the African American category on average, and the Caucasian category will have \\$12.50 less debt that the African American category. However, p-values associated with the coefficient estimates for the two dummy variables are very large, suggesting no statistical evidence of a real difference in credit card balance between the ethnicities. The coefficients will change bassed on the baseline and coding.\n\nRather than relying on the individual coefficients, we can use F-test to test $H_0 : \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = 0$; this does not depend on the coding. The F-test has a p-value of 0.9575, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between `balance` and `ethnicity`.\n\nUsing this dummy variable approach presents no difficulties when using both quantitative and qualitative predictors. For example, to regress `balance` on both a quantitative varaible such as `income` and a qualitative variable such as `student`, we must simply create a dummy varaible for `student` and then fit a multiple linear regression model using `income` and the dummy variable as the predictors for credit card balance.\n\n### Extensions of the Linear Model\n\nLinear regression model is very interpretable and works quite well on many real-world problems. However, it makes several highly restrictive assumptions that are ofthen violated in practice. Two of them ost important assumptions state that the relationship between the predictors and response are *additive* and *linear*.\n\nThe *additive* assumption means that the effect of changes in a predictor $x_j$ on the response $Y$ is independent of the vlaues of the other predictors.\n\nThe *linear* assumption means thatt the change in the response $Y$ due to one-unit change in $x_j$ is constant, regardless of the vlaue of $x_j$.\n\nWe can relax these assumptions. Here some classical approaches to do that\n\n**Removing the Additive Assumption**\n\nFrom `Advertising` data, we concluded that both `TV` and `radio` seem to be associated with `sales`. Our model was linear; the effect of `TV` and `radio` advertising spending on sales is independent of each other, and their effect is constant no matter the level of spending.\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TV_i + \\beta_2 radio_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$ this model means that, the average effect on sales of a one unit increase in tv is always $\\beta_1$ regardless of the amount spent on radio.\n\nHowever, this simple model may be incorrect. Suppose that spending money on radio advertising actually increases the effectiveness of TV advertising, so that the slope term for `TV` should increase as `radio` increases. In this situation, given a fixed budget \\$100,000, spending half on `radio` and half on `TV` may increase `sales` more than allocating the entire amount to either `TV` or to `radio`. In marketing this is known as the *synergy effect*, in statistics *interaction effect*.\n\nConsider the standard linear regression with two variables,\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\epsilon\n$$ Here if we increaes $x_1$ by one unit, $Y$ will increase by an average of $\\beta_1$ units. The presence of $x_2$ does not alter this statement-regardless of the value of $x_2$, a one-unit increase in $x_1$ will lead to $\\beta_1$ unit increae in $Y$.\n\nWe can extend this model by allowing interaction effects by including a third predictor, called an *interaction term*, which is constructed by computing the product of $x_1$ and $x_2$:\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \\epsilon\n$$ (3.31)\n\nWe can write this equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nY &= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 x_2)x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 +\\epsilon \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + \\tilde{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n$$ where $\\tilde{\\beta_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3x_2$. Since $\\tilde{\\beta_1}$ changes with $x_2$, the effect of $x_1$ on $Y$ is no longer constant: adjusting $x_2$ will change the impact of $x_1$ on $Y$.\n\n::: callout-note\n# Productivy of a factory\n\nSuppose that we are interested in studying the productivity of a factory. We want to predict the number of `units` produced on the basis of the number of production `lines` and the total number of `workers`. Probably the effect of increasing `lines` on `units` produced will depend on the number of `workers`, since if no workers are available to operate the lines, then increasing the number of lines will not increase the production. This suggest to include an interaction term between `lines` and `workers` in a linear model to predict `units`.\n\nSuppose when we fit the model, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nunits &\\approx 1.2 + 3.4 \\times lines + 0.22 \\times workers + 1.4 \\times (lines \\times workers) \\\\\n&= 1.2 + (3.4 + 1.4 \\times workers) \\times lines + 0.22 \\times workers\n\\end{align}\n$$ Adding an addtional line will increase the number of units produced by $3.4 + 1.4 \\times workers$. Hence, the more `workers` we have, the stronger will be the effect of `lines`.\n:::\n\nFor the advitising, a linear model that uses `radio`, `TV` and interaction between the two to predict `sales` takes the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nsales &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV + \\beta_2 \\times radio + \\beta_3 \\times(radio \\times TV) + \\epsilon \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 \\times radio)\\times Tv + \\beta_2 \\times radio + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.33) We can interpret $\\beta_3$ as the increase in the effectiveness of TV advertising for a one unit increse in radio advertising (or vice versa). The coefficients that result from fitting the model (3.33) are\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio + TV*radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nAdding the interaction term increased the $R^2$ significantly from 0.8972 to 0.9678, RSE from 1.681 to 0.9435.\n\nThe p-value for the interaction term is very low; $H_\\alpha : \\beta_3 \\neq 0$. This means that the relationship is not additive.\n\nTo interpret the coefficients:\n\n\\$1,000 increse in `TV` advertising results with $\\hat{\\beta_1} +\\hat{\\beta_3}\\times radio = \\$19.1 + \\$1.09 \\times radio$ increase in sales on average.\n\n\\$1,000 invrease in `radio` advertising results with $\\hat{\\beta_2} + \\hat{\\beta_3} \\times TV = \\$28.9 + \\$1.09 \\times TV$ increase in sales on average.\n\nAll p-values are significant =\\> all three varibles should be included in the model.\n\nSometimes interaction term has a very small pvalue but the associated main effects(in this case `TV` and `radio`) do not. The *hieararchial principle states that if we include an interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects, even if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not significant.*\n\nHere both our varaibles were quantitative. However, the consept of interaction applies to qualitative varaibles, or combination of qualitative and quantitative varibles. Actually interaction between a quantitative and qualitative variable has a particularly nice interpreateion:\n\nConsider the `Credit` data set. Suppose we want to predict `balance` using `income`(quantitative) and `student`(qualitative) varaibles. In the absence of an interaction term the model takes the form\n\n$$\nbalance_i  \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times income_i + \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_2 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is not student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$$\nbalance_i = \\beta_1 \\times income + \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student} \\\\\n\\beta_0 &\\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.34)\n\nNotice that this amounts to fitting two parallel lines to the data, one for students and one for non-students. The lines for students and non students have different intercepts, $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2$ versus $\\beta_0$, but the slope $\\beta_1$ is the same.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Income + Student, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nAverage Non student balance is \\$211.1430; students have \\$382.6705 more balance on average compared to non students. \\$1,000 increase in income increases balance by \\$5,984 on average. All coefficients are statistically significant. $R^2 = 0.2775$\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\nCredit %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(y=Balance, x=Income) + geom_point(shape =NA) + geom_abline(intercept = 211.1430, slope = 5.9843, color = \"black\", size=1.2) + geom_abline(intercept = 593.8135, slope = 5.9843, color = \"darkred\", size= 1.2) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,150), ylim=c(200,1400)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1400,400)) + theme_clean() + geom_text(data = tibble(x = c(80,80), y =c(1130,640), z = c(\"Student\",\"non-student\")), inherit.aes = F, aes(x=x, y=y, label=z), angle=25.9) -> p1\np1\n```\n\nNotice the since the slopes are same, two lines are parallel; average effect of income on balance does not depend on whether or not the individual is a student. This is a limitation; change in income may have a very different effect on the credit card balance of a student versus non student.\n\nThis limitation can be addressed by adding an interaction varaible, created by multiplying `student` and `income` with the dummy for student. Our model now becomes\n\n$$\nbalance_i \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times income_i + \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 \\times income_i & \\text{if student} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if not student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ $$\nbalance_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n(\\beta_0 + \\beta_2) + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) \\times income_i & \\text{if student} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times income_i & \\text{if not student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.35)\n\nAgain, our intercepts differ based on whether individual is student or not. However, this time slope also differs!\n\nLets estimate this model\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Income + Student + Income * Student, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThis results in\n\n```{r}\ntibble(\n  intercept = c(200.6232, 200.6232+476.6758),\n  income = c(6.2182, 6.2182 - 1.9992),\n  type = c(\"Non-student\", \"student\")\n)\n```\n\nand becomes\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\nCredit %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x = Income, y = Balance) + geom_point(shape =NA)+\n  geom_abline(intercept = 201, slope = 6.22, color = \"black\", size =1.2) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 677, slope = 4.22, size = 1.2, color = \"darkred\") +  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,150), ylim=c(200,1400)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1400,400)) + theme_clean() + geom_text(data = tibble(x = c(80,80), y =c(1130,640), z = c(\"Student\",\"non-student\")), inherit.aes = F, aes(x=x, y=y, label=z), angle=25.9) -> p2\np2\n```\n\nLets merge this two plots together\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2, ncol =2)\n```\n\nSlope for studens is lower than the slope for non-students =\\> increases in income are associated with smaller increases in credit card balance among students as copared to non-students.\n\n**Not-linear Relationships**\n\nLinear model assumes linear relationship between the response and the predictors. However, this is often not true. We can relax this assumption using *polynomial regression*.\n\nConsider `Auto`\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: linear regresion fit is in orange, blue curve is a linear regression fit for a model that includes horsepower^2, and green curve includes up to horsepower^5\nAuto %>% as_tibble() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=horsepower, y = mpg) + geom_point(shape =1, size =1.4) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F, color =\"#FEBF63\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,2), color =\"#7FDBDA\", se = F) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,5), color =\"#ADE498\", se=F) + theme_blank() \n```\n\nIt is obvious that there is relationship between `mpg` and `horsepower`. But it seems like this relationship is not linear: the data suggest a curved relationship.\n\nA simple approach for incorporating non linear associations in a linear model is to include transformed versions of the predictors in the model. For example figure above seem to have a *quadratic* shape, suggesting that a model of the form\n\n$$\nmpg = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times horsepower + \\beta_2 \\times horsepower^2 + \\epsilon\n$$ May be a better fit. Equation\n\nYou can do it in different ways: 1.\n\n```{r}\nAuto %>% \n  mutate(hp.sq = horsepower^2) %>% \n  lm(mpg~horsepower + hp.sq,.) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\n2.  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), Auto))\n```\n\n3.  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower,2, raw=T), Auto))\n```\n\n4.  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(nls(mpg ~a + b * horsepower + c * horsepower^2, data = Auto, start = c(a=0,b=0,c=0)))\n```\n\n--\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2),Auto))\n```\n\nThe $R^2$ of the quadratic fit is 0.688, compared to 0.606 for the linear fit. And the p-value is highly significant for quadratic model.\n\nIf adding $horsepower^2$ increses the $R^2$ why not include $^3$ or $^4$ or more?\n\nLets estimate the green curve on the previous plot\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(horsepower ~ poly(horsepower,5, raw=T),Auto))\n```\n\nThe green fit seems unnecassasrliy wiggly- that is it is unclear includig the additional terms really has led to a better fit to the data.\n\nThe approach we have just described for extending the linear model to accomodate non-linear relationships is known as *polynomial regression*, since we have included polynomial functions of the predictors in the regression model. Check out Chapter 7.\n\n### Potential Problems\n\nWhen we fit a linear regression model to a particular data set, many problems may occur. Most common among these are the following\n\n1.  *Non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships*.\n\n2.  *Correalation of error terms*\n\n3.  *Non-constant variance of error terms*\n\n4.  *Outliers*\n\n5.  *High-leverage points*\n\n6.  *Collinearity*\n\nLets breifly discuss each\n\n**1.Non-linearity of the Data**\n\nLinear regression assumes there is a straight line relationship between the predictors and the respose. If the true relationship is far from linear, then our estimations are not good. Also our prediction accuracy is reduced.\n\n*Residual plots* are a useful graphical tool for identifying non-linearity.\n\nWe can plot the residuals $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i}$ versus $x_i$ for Simple linear regression.\n\nFor multiple linear regression since we have lost of $x_i$ we plot residuals versus predicted values($e_i$ vs $\\hat{y_i}$).\n\nWe want to have *no visible pattern*. If there is a pattern =\\> problem!\n\nSo what do we expect a plot of \"fitted\" vs \"resid\"; if the relationship is linear as the \"fitted\" values increase \"resid\" should not increase or decrease, should swing with no relationship: linear.\n\nIf the relationship is not linear then we expect ot see a pattern because as the fitted values increase the resiudls will increase.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() \n```\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=horsepower, y = .resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + theme_light()\n```\n\nHere we observe a U-shape trend; indicating non-linear relationship between `horsepower` and `mpg`.\n\nLets do a plot of fitted vs residual for linear and non linear regression:\n\n```{r}\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") + theme_light()\n,\n\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") + theme_light(), ncol=2)\n```\n\nHere is the plots. On the left fitted vs resid for regressing horsepower onto mpg, on the right regressing horsepower and horsepower\\^2 onto mpg.\n\nBlue line is a smooth fit to the residuals to identify trends easily. The residuals on the left panel exhibit a clear U shape, which is a strong indication that the true relationship is not linear.\n\nRight hand panel displays a little pattern, suggesting that the quadratic term improves the fit to the data.\n\nIf the residual plot indicates that there are non-linear associations in the data, then a simple approach is to use non-linear transformations of the predictors, such as $\\log X$, $\\sqrt{X}$, and $X^2$, in the regression model. We will discuss more later on.\n\n**2.Correlation of Error Terms**\n\nAn important assumption of the linear regression is that error terms $\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\dots, \\epsilon_n$ are uncorrelated. This means that $\\epsilon_{i+1} \\neq f(\\epsilon_i)$. The standard errors that are computed for the estimated regression coeffieints or the fitted values are based on this assumption. If there is correaltion among the error terms, the estimated standard errors will tend to underestimate the true standard errors =\\> confidence and prediction intervals will be narrower than they should be. P-values will be lower as well, causing false discoveries perhaps.\n\nUsually correlation among error terms occur in *time series* data. In many cases, observations that are obtained at adjacent time points will have positevely correalated errors. To test this we can plot the residuals from our model as a function of time. If the errors are uncorrelated, then we expect no pattern. If the error terms are positevly correlated, then we may see *tracking* in the residuals--*adjacent residuals may have similar values*.\n\n![](fig3.10.png) Check out Figure 3.10. In the top panel, we see the residuals from a linear regression fit to data generated with uncorrelated errors. Adjacent years don't take similar values; there is no evidence of a time-related trend in the residuals. But in the bottom panel, we see plotted residuals which have correlation 0.9 with time: now there is a clear pattern in the residuals--adjacent residuals tend to take on similar values. Finally, the center panel illustrates a more moderate case in which residuals had a correlation of 0.5. There is still evidence of tracking, but the pattern is less clear.\n\nCorrelation among the error terms can also occur outside of time series data. For instance, consider a study where we predict people's hights from their weights. The assumption of uncorrelated errors could be violated if some of the individauls in the study are members of the same family, or eat the same diet, or have been exposed to same environmental factors.\n\n**3.Non-constant Variance of Error Terms**\n\nAnother important assumption of the linear regression model is that error terms have a constant variance, $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2$. The standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests rely upon this assumption.\n\nUnfortunately, often variances of the error terms are non-constant =\\> *heteroscedasticity*. For instance, variances of the error terms may increase with the value of the response. We can identify non-constant variances in the errors from the presence of a *funnel shape* in the residual plot.\n\n![](fig3.11.png) On the left panel magnitude of the residuals tends to increase with the fitted values. When faced with this problem, one possible solution is to transform the response $Y$ using a concave function such as $\\log Y$ or $\\sqrt{Y}$. Such a transformation results in a greater amount of shrinkage of the larger responses, leading to a reduction in heteroscedasticity. On the right hand panel we see that residuals apper to have constant variance.\n\n**4.Outliers**\n\nAn *outlier* is a point for which $y_i$ is far from the vlaue predicted by the model.\n\n![](fig3.12.png)\n\nThe red point (observation 20) in the left-hand panel of Figure 3.12 illustrates a typical outlier. The red solid line is the least squares regression fit, while the blue dashed line is the least squares fit after removel of the outlier. In this case, removing the outlier has little effect on the least squares line: it leads to almost no change in the slope, and a minuscule reduction in the intercept. This is normal. However, it can cause other problems: RSE is 1.09 when outlier is included, but it is only 0.77 when excluded =\\> RSE is used to calculate all confidence intervals, p values =\\> bias. $R^2$ also decreases from 0.829 to 0.805 when included outlier.\n\nResidual plots can be used to identify outliers =\\> center panel of Figure 3.12. But it can be difficult to decide how large a residual needs to before we consider the point to be an outlier. To address this problem instead of plotting the residuals we can plot the *studentized residuals* computed by dividing each residuls $e_i$ by its estimated standard error.\n\n$$\ne_i^*=\\frac{e_i}{sd(e_i)} = \\frac{e_i}{\\sqrt{MSE(1-h_{ii})}}\n$$ $h_{ii}$ is leverage point.\n\nObservations whose studentized residuals are greater than 3 in absolute value are possible outliers. In the right-hand panel of Figure 3.12 the outlier's studentized residual exceeds 6; while all other observations have studentized residauls between -2 and 2.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales~TV + radio,advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  mutate(.std.resid_3 = ifelse(abs(.std.resid) >=3,T,F), id = 1:200) %>% \n  print %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y =.std.resid, color = .std.resid_3) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\",\"red\")) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(.std.resid_3 == T,id,\"\")), nudge_x = 0.5, show.legend = F)+ theme_light() \n```\n\nor\n\n```{r}\nplot(lm(sales ~ TV + radio,advertising), which = 3)\n```\n\nWe have spotted that 6th and 131 are possible outliers.\n\nHere is all the data regression result:\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  car::outlierTest()-> outs\nouts # 131th value is outlier\n```\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  car::outlierTest(., cutoff = 0.30)\n```\n\n\nHere is regression result after removing outliers\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising[-c(6,131),]) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\n$R^2$ has increased, residual standard errors has decreased, standard errors of estimates decreased and coefficients has changed.\n\n**5.High Leverage Points**\n\nOutliers are observations for which the response $y_i$ is unusual given the predictor $x_i$. In contrast, observations with *high leverage* have an unusual value for $x_i$.\n\n![](fig3.13.png)\n\nFor example observation 41 in the left-hand panel of Figure 3.13 has high leverage =\\> predictor value for this observation is large relative to other observations. The red solid line is the least squares fit to the data, the blue dashed line is the fit when obs 41 is removed.\n\nRemoving the high leverage observation has a much more substantial impact on the least squares line than removing an outlier. High leverage obss have a big impact on the estiamted regression line. It is important to identify them.\n\nFor SLR =\\> look at the range of $x_i$ and spot the out of range observations.\n\nMLR =\\> it is possible to have an observation that is well within the range of each individual predictor's values, but that is unusual in terms of the full set of predictors.\n\nHave a look at the center panel in Figure 3.13. Most of the observations' predictor values fall within the blue dashed ellipse, but the red observation is well outside of this range. But neither its value for $x_1$ nor $x_2$ is unusual.\n\nWe can quantify an observation's leverage using the *leverage statistic*. A large value indicates a high leverage.\n\nFor SLR:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nh_i &= \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{i'=1}^n(x_{i'} - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\\n&1/n \\leq h_i \\leq 1 \\\\\n&\\bar{h_i} = (p+1)/n\n\\end{align}\n$$ as $x_i$ increases its distance from $\\bar{x}$ $h_i$ increases.\n\n$h_i$ is always between $1/n$ and $1$, and the average leverage for all the observations is always equal to $(p+1)/n$. If an observation has a $h$ that greatly exceeds $(p+1)/n$ then we may suspect of high leverage.\n\nRight hand panel of Figure 3.13 shows studentized residuals versus $h_i$. Obs 41 stands out as having a very high leverage statistic as well as a high studentized residual =\\> It is an outlier as well as a high leverage observaiton. This is very dangerous. This plot also shows the reason that obs 20 had relatively little effect on the least sqaures fit in Figure 3.12: it has low leverage.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment()\n```\n\nleverages are shown in `.hat` here.\n\n```{r}\nplot(lm(sales~TV,advertising), which = 5)\n```\n\n**6.Collinearity**\n\n*Collinearity* refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables are closely related to one another.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Figure 3.14\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\n  Credit %>% ggplot() + aes(x=Limit, y = Age) + geom_point(color =\"red\", alpha =0.4),\n  Credit %>% ggplot() + aes(x=Limit, y= Rating) + geom_point(color =\"red\", alpha = 0.4),\n  ncol=2\n)\n```\n\nIn the left panel of Figure 3.14 we see no relationship, but on the right hand panel predicors are highly correlated: they are *collinear* =\\> it is difficult to seperate out the individual effects of colliniar varaibles on the response.\n\nCollinearity reduces the accuracy of the estiamtes of the regression coefficients, it causes the standard error for $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ to grow. t-statistic for each predictor is calculated by dividing $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ by its standard error =\\> collinearity declines the t-statistics =\\> we may fail to reject $H_0:\\beta_j = 0$.\n\nLets do two regressions:\n\n-   model1: balance regressed onto age and limit which has no collinearity\n-   model2: balance regressed onto rating and limit which are collinear.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Age + Limit, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  tidy() %>% mutate(model = 1) %>% \n  bind_rows(\n    linear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Rating + Limit, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  tidy() %>% mutate(model =2)\n  )\n```\n\nIn the first model both `age` and `limit` are statistically significant. In the second, collinearity between `limit` and `raiting` has caused standard error for the limit coefficient estimate to increase by a factor of 12 and p-value to increase to 0.701. The importance of the limit variable has been masked due to presence of collinearity.\n\nA simple way to detect collinearity is to look at the correlation matrix of the predictors. Correlation matrix shows the relatinship of two variables but, it is possible for colşinearty to exist between three or more varaibles even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation. This situation is called *multicollinaerity*.\n\nInstead of inspecting the correlatino matrix, better way to assess multicollinaerity is to compute the *variance inflation factor* (VIF). The VIF is the raio of the variance of $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ when fitting the model divided by the variance of $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ if fit on its own.\n\n$$\n1 \\leq VIF\n$$ Smallest possible value of VIF is 1: complete absence of collinearity. Usuall there is always some degree of collinearity among the predictors. A VIF that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinaerity.\n\nThe VIF for each vairable can be computed using the formula\n\n$$\nVIF(\\hat{\\beta_j}) = \\frac{1}{1-R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}}\n$$ $R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}$ is the $R^2$ from a regression of $x_j$ onto all of the other predictors. If $R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}$ is close to one, then collinearity is present, so VIF will be large.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Age + Rating + Limit, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  car::vif() \n```\n\nA regression of balance on age, rating, and limit indicates that the predictors have VIF Values of 1.01, 160.67, 160.59. There is considerable collinearity in the data.\n\nWhen faced with collinearity, two simple solutions exist: \\* drop one of the problematic variables from the regression \\* combine collinear variables together into a single predictor. We might take the average of standardized versions of limit and rating in order to create a new varaible that measures *credit worthiness*.\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising) %>% summary()\n```\n\n\nTo get a anova table;\n```{r}\nanova(lm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\ncoef(lm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising) %>% confint()\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nvcov(lm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising))\n```\n\n# Selecting best regression varaibles\n\nYou are creating a new regression mdoel or improving an exiting model. You have many regression varaibles and you want to select the vest subset of those varaibles.\n\nThe `step` function can perform stepwise regression, either forward or backward. Backward stepwise regression starts with many varaibles and removes the underperformeners:\n\n```{r}\nlm <- lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising) # full model\nstats::step(lm, direction = \"backward\") %>% summary() # best model\n```\n\nbackward stepwise regression is the easiest approach.\n\nBackward stepwise is easy but sometimes its not feasible to start with everything because you have too many candidate variables. In that case use forward stepwise regression; which will start with nothing and incrementatlly add variables that improve regression. It stops when no further improvement is possible\n\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales ~ 1,advertising)\n```\n\nwe start with minimum model. We must tell step which candidate varaibels are available for inclusing in the model. We use `scope` argument for that.\n\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~1,advertising) %>% stats::step(direction = \"forward\", scope = (~ TV + radio + newspaper), trace = 0) %>% summary() \n```\nwe have the same result with backward, in reality these results may differ.\n```{r}\nstats::step(lm, direction = \"both\") %>% summary() \n```\n\n```{r}\nMASS::boxcox(lm)\n```\n\nDetecting the outliers :\n\n```{r}\ncar::outlierTest(lm)\n```\n\n\n![](rcook1.png)\n\n\n\n\n![](rcook2.png)\n\n\n### Identifying Influential observations\n\nYou want to identify the observatipons that are having the ost influence on the regression model, this is useful for diagnosing possible porblems with the data.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe `influence.measures` function reports several useful statistics for identifying inflıuentioal obs. and it flags the significant ones with an asterisk(*).\n\n```{r}\nlm <- lm(sales~TV + newspaper,advertising)\nlm %>% summary() %>% print() # r2 is 0.6422\n\ninf = influence.measures(lm)\n```\n\nWe need to filter for columns which has at least one true:\n```{r}\nas.data.frame(inf$is.inf) %>% as_tibble() %>% \n  mutate(obs = 1:200) %>% \n  filter(if_any(everything(), ~. == TRUE)) %>% print() %>% \n  pull(\"obs\") -> infss\ninfss\n```\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~TV + newspaper,advertising[-infss,]) %>% summary() # r^2 improves!\nlm12 <-lm(sales~TV + newspaper,advertising[-infss,])\n```\n\n\n## testing residuals for autocorrelation\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(lmtest)\ndwtest(lm) \n```\n\nif $ p > 0.05$ no evidence of correaltion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Linear Regression\n\nWe will predict quantitative response.\n\n```{r}\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\nlibrary(ISLR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(corrplot)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(dotwhisker)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n})\ntheme_set(theme_ipsum_ps(axis_title_size = 11 , axis_title_just = \"c\") + theme(axis.line = element_line(color =\"black\")))\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\nadvertising = read_csv(\"./data/Advertising.csv\") %>% as_tibble %>% select(-1)\nadvertising\n```\n\nWe are asked to suggest a marketing plan for next year which will yeild high product sales. We may want to inquire the following questions:\n\n1.  *Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?*\n\n    First we should determine if there is an association between adveritisng expenditure and sales. If not, no money shpuld be spent on advertising.\n\n2.  *How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?*\n\n    If there is a relationship between advertising and sales, what is the strength of this relationship? Given a certain advertising budget, can we predict sales with a high level of accuracy? =\\> strong relationsihp.\n\n3.  *Which media contribute to sales?*\n\n    Do all variables--tv,radio,newspaper-- contribute to sales, or just one or the two?\n\n4.  *How accurately can we estimate the effect of each medium on sales?*\n\n    For every ollar spent on advertising in a particular medium, by what amount will sales increase? How accuretly can we predict this amount of increase?\n\n5.  *How accurately can we predict future sales?*\n\n    For any given level of media advertisig, what is our prediction for sales, and what is the accuracy of this prediciton?\n\n6.  *Is the relationship linear?*\n\n    If so linear regresion is appropriate tool, if not we may need to transform the predictor or the repsonse so that liner regression can be used.\n\n7.  *Is there synergy among the advertising media?*\n\n    Does the effect of a medium on sales depend on other medium levels? Does dividing advertisement budget to two or three medium yeild a higher sales?\n\nWe can answer each of these questions using Linear regression.\n\n## Simple Linear Regression\n\nPredicting a quantitative response $Y$ on the basis of a single predictor variable $X$.\n\nOur assumption is that there is approximately a linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$; we can write this linear relationship as\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n$$\nY \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\n$$ (3.1)\n\nFor example lets say $X$ is `TV`, and $Y$ is `sales`\n\n$$\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV + \\epsilon\n$$ or\n\n$$\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV\n$$\n\nOn (3.1) $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are unknown constants that represent the *intercept* and *slope* in the linear model. Together they are known as *coefficients* or *parameters*.\n\nWe are going to use or training data to produce estimates for $\\beta_0$ =\\> $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\beta_1$ =\\> $\\hat{\\beta_1}$. Using these predicted coefficients we can predict sales;\n\n$$\n\\hat{sales} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\times TV\n$$\n\nor as in general form\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x\n$$ (3.2)\n\n### Estimating the coefficients\n\nSince, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are unknown, before we can use (3.1) to make predictions we must use data to estimate the coefficients. We have $n$ observations :\n\n$$\n(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \\dots, (x_n,y_n)\n$$\n\nWe want our estimated coefficients to give such predictions that will fit the avaible data as well =\\> $y_i \\approx \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i$ for $i = 1,\\dots, n$. This coefficients will allow us to draw a regression line and we want this regression line to be close as possible to the $n$ data points we have.\n\nThere are different ways to measure *closeness*. The most common approach is minimizing the *least squares* criterion. Alternative approaches will be considered in Chapter 6.\n\nOur predictions come from $\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i$.\n\nThen for each data we have a *residual*: difference between $y$ and $\\hat{y}$:\n\n$$\ne_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i}\n$$\n\nWe need to take the squares to get the distances--because of the negative residuals, and sum them to get the *residual sum of squares*(RSS)\n\n$$\nRSS = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_n^2\n$$\n\nthis is equal to\n\n$$\nRSS = (y_i - \\hat{beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1)^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_2) + \\dots + (y_n - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_n)\n$$ (3.3)\n\nThe least squares approach chooses $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ to minimize RSS. These minimizers are\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\beta_1} &= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\\n\\hat{\\beta_0} &= \\bar{y_i} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x}\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.4)\n\n$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$ and $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$ are the sample means.\n\nSo (3.4) defines the *least squares coefficient estimates* for simple linear regression.\n\nLets calculate them with R\n\n```{r}\nbeta_1_hat_adv = sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV)) * ((advertising$sales - mean(advertising$sales)))) / sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV))^2)\nbeta_1_hat_adv\n```\n\nSo; our \\$\\hat{\\beta_1} = 0.0475 \\$\n\n```{r}\nbeta_0_hat_adv = mean(advertising$sales) - beta_1_hat_adv * mean(advertising$TV)\nbeta_0_hat_adv\n```\n\nour $\\hat{\\beta_0} = 7.032$\n\nLets compare them with r function\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, data = advertising))\n```\n\nCalculating the predicted values\n\n```{r}\ny_hat_adv = beta_0_hat_adv + beta_1_hat_adv * advertising$TV\ny_hat_adv[1:10]\n```\n\nOur $y_i$ values are as above.\n\n```{r}\nRSS = sum((advertising$sales - y_hat_adv)^2)\nRSS\n```\n\nOur $\\text{RSS} = 2102.531$\n\nSo we can draw our regression line\n\n```{r fig.width=10}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| fig-cap: For the advertising data, the least squares fit for the regression of sales onto TV.

We don't know $f$, and $\\epsilon$ is a mean-zero random error term.\n\nWe said $f$ is approximatly linear, so that $f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$; which means\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\n$$ (3.5)\n\nerror term captures: \\* the true relationship may not be linear \\* other variables that affect Y \\* measurement error\n\nand is independent of $X$.\n\n(3.5) is the *population regression line*: the best linar approximation to the true relationship between $X$ and $Y$.\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}X\n$$ is the *least squares line*. They are different of course! But we don't know the population regression line. If we did:\n\nFor example, lets create a data;\n\n-   First we create random x values from 100 random numbers\n\n```{r}\nseq(-2,2,length.out=100)[1:10]\n```\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(11)\nx = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\nx[1:10]\n```\n\nlets define our $f$--population parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$\n\n$$\nf(X) = 2 + 3\\times X\n$$ Now lets create our $Y$ values from this function but we also want to add random error values as well\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(11)\ny = 2 + 3*x + rnorm(100)\ny[1:10]\n```\n\nSo we have a data set\n\n```{r}\ndata = tibble(\n  y = y, x = x\n)\n```\n\nNow lets plot this data points\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=x, y=y) + geom_point() \n```\n\nNow, even though we already know $f$ and population parameters $\\beta_0 = 2$ and $\\beta_1 = 3$, lets estimate them:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(y ~ x, data = data))\n```\n\nSo our *least squares estimation is*\n\n$$\n\\hat{y_i} = 1.88 + 3.06 x_i\n$$ Lets draw this *least squares regression line to our plot*\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=x, y=y) + geom_point() + geom_abline(intercept=1.88, slope = 3.06, size = 1.2) + theme_par()\n```\n\nWhat about the population regression line\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=x, y=y) + geom_point() + geom_abline(intercept = 1.9, slope = 3.06, size = 1.2) + geom_abline(intercept = 2, slope = 3, color =\"red\") + theme_par()\n```\n\nThey are not the same! If we were to have another data from the same data generation process other estimates of parameters would result with different *least squares regression lines*:\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(111)\nx_r1 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r1 = 2 + 3*x_r1 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(1111)\nx_r2 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r2 = 2 + 3*x_r2 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(11111)\nx_r3 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r3 = 2 + 3*x_r3 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(111111)\nx_r4 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r4 = 2 + 3*x_r4 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(1111111)\nx_r5 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r5 = 2 + 3*x_r5 + rnorm(100)\nset.seed(11111111)\nx_r6 = sample(seq(-2,2,length.out = 100),size = 100, replace = T)\ny_r6 = 2 + 3*x_r6 + rnorm(100)\n```\n\nLets now estimate population parameters for each of these data and plot them\n\n```{r}\ndata_r = tibble(\n  y_r1,x_r1,y_r2,x_r2,y_r3,x_r3,y_r4,x_r4, y_r5,x_r5,y_r6,x_r6\n)\ndata_r\n```\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x,y) + geom_point(size = 0, color = \"white\")  + \n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r1 ~ x_r1)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r1 ~ x_r1)$coefficients[2], color =\"#29019F\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r2 ~ x_r2)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r2 ~ x_r2)$coefficients[2], color =\"#0A04BF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r3 ~ x_r3)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r3 ~ x_r3)$coefficients[2], color =\"#0930DF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r4 ~ x_r4)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r4 ~ x_r4)$coefficients[2], color =\"#0E6DFF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r5 ~ x_r5)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r5 ~ x_r5)$coefficients[2], color =\"#2BA8FF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = lm(y_r6 ~ x_r6)$coefficients[1], slope = lm(y_r6 ~ x_r6)$coefficients[2], color =\"#48D9FF\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept =2, slope =3, color = \"red\") +\n  \n  theme_par()\n```\n\nSo, different data sets generated from the same true model result in slightly different least squares lines, but the unobserved population regression line does not change.\n\nThis is because we are using a sample, and estimating characteristics of the population. Usually these characteristics are different, but generally sample characteristics will provide a good estimate to the population characteristics.\n\nComputing $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ from different sets of sample data provide different but similar results. And we are trying to estimate population parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ with these. Some of these $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ will overestimate, some will underestimate $\\beta_0$, and $\\beta_1$. But if we could average all these estimated parameters and take the average, than this average should be equal to population parameters; if this is the case this estimator is called *unbiased estimator*. So an unbiased estimator does not *systematically* over- or under-estimate the true parameter.\n\nOkay but how close $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ are to the true values $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. We want to compute the standard errors associated with $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$. Standard error telss us the average amount of estimate differes from the actual value.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0})^2 &= \\sigma^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x}^2)}\\right] \\\\\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})^2 &= \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.8)\n\nWhere $\\sigma^2=\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)$.\n\nNotice that formula of $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ is smaller when $x_i$ are more spread out; intutively we have more *leverage* to estimate a slope when this is the case.\n\nIn general $\\sigma^2$ is not known, but can be estimated from the data. The estimate of $\\sigma$ is known as the *residual standard error*, and given by the formula\n\n$$\n\\text{RSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{RSS}/(n-2)}\n$$ So, when $\\sigma^2$ is estimated fro mthe data we should write $\\hat{\\text{SE}}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ to indicate that an estimate has been made, but usually we drop this extra hat.\n\nStandard errors can be used to compute *confidence intervals*. A 95% confidence interval is defines as a range of values such that with 95% probability, the rage will contain the true unknown value of the parameter. The range is defined in terms of lower and upper limits computed from the sample of data. For linear regression, the 95% confidence interval for $\\beta_1$ approximately takes the form\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta_1} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}) \n$$ (3.9)\n\nSo there is approximately a 95% chance that the interval $$[\\hat{\\beta_1} - 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}), \\hat{\\beta_1} + 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta-1})]$$ (3.10) will contain the true value of $\\beta_1$. Same is true for $\\beta_0$\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta_0} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0})\n$$ (3.11)\n\nLets calculate the confidence intervals for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ from our original data and model\n\n$$\n\\hat{sales_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}\\cdot TV\n$$ We first need to calculate RSS and RSE:\n\n$$\n\\text{RSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\n$$\n\n```{r}\nRSS = sum((advertising$sales - y_hat_adv)^2)\nRSS\n```\n\n$$\n\\text{RSE} = \\sigma = \\sqrt{RSS/(n-2)}\n$$\n\n```{r}\nRSE = sqrt((RSS / (length(advertising$sales) -2)))\nRSE\n```\n\nFor $\\beta_0$\n\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0}) = \\sigma^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\right]\n$$\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_0_adv =  sqrt(RSE^2 * (1/length(advertising$sales) + (mean(advertising$TV)^2 / sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV))^2))))\nse_beta_0_adv\n```\n\nSo we can calculate the confidence interval for $\\beta_0$\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"In the absence of any advertising, sales will on average, fall somewhere between\",beta_0_hat_adv - 1.96 * se_beta_0_adv, \"and\", beta_0_hat_adv + 1.96 * se_beta_0_adv)\n```\n\nFor $\\hat{\\beta_1}$:\n\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})^2 =\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n$$\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_1_adv = sqrt(RSE^2 / (sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV))^2)))\nse_beta_1_adv\n```\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"For each $1,000 increase in TV advertising, average increase in sales will be between\",(beta_1_hat_adv - 1.96 * se_beta_1_adv) * 1000, \"and\", (beta_1_hat_adv + 1.96 * se_beta_1_adv)*1000, \"by 95% confidence\")\n```\n\nLets confirm our results\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nconfint(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\nSo standard errors of our estimated parameters tells us the average amount of difference from the true population parameters. And using the confidence intervals we can tell a range of the true population parameters' interval with a percentage (usually 95%).\n\nLets do this for our `data` as well, which we know has the form\n\n$$\ny_i = 2 + 3 x_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$ Lets calculate $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ first\n\n```{r}\nbeta_1_hat_data = sum((data$x - mean(data$x)) * (data$y - mean(data$y))) / sum((data$x - mean(data$x))^2)\nbeta_1_hat_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nbeta_0_hat_data = mean(data$y) - beta_1_hat_data * mean(data$x)\nbeta_0_hat_data\n```\n\n$$\n\\hat{y_i} = 1.88 + 3.05 x_i\n$$\n\nlets confirm this\n\n```{r}\nlm(y~x, data)\n```\n\nLets calculate the residual sum of squares, residual sum of errors, standard errors, and confidence intervals\n\n```{r}\ndata %>% \n  mutate(\n    y_hat = beta_0_hat_data + beta_1_hat_data * x\n  ) -> data\n\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSS_data = sum((data$y - data$y_hat)^2)\nRSS_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSE_data = sqrt((RSS_data/(length(data$y) -2)))\nRSE_data\n```\n\nso $\\sigma_{data} = 0.9163$\n\nWe can now compute the standard errors of estiamed coefficients\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_0_data = sqrt(((1/length(data$y)) + (mean(data$x)^2 / sum((data$x - mean(data$x))^2))) * RSE_data^2)\nse_beta_0_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nse_beta_1_data = sqrt(RSE_data^2 / (sum((data$x - mean(data$x))^2)))\nse_beta_1_data\n```\n\nLets confirm\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(y~x,data))\n```\n\nSo we can say that on average our $\\hat{\\beta_0}$s are 0.091 differ from $\\beta_0$, and our $\\hat{\\beta_1}$s differ 0.076 from $\\beta_1$. To make more sense of it we can calculate the confidence intervals\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"By 95% confidence we can say that the true beta_0 is between\", beta_0_hat_data - 1.96 * se_beta_0_data, \"and\", beta_0_hat_data + 1.96 * se_beta_0_data )\n```\n\n```{r}\ncat(\"By 95% confidence we can say that the true beta_0 is between\", beta_1_hat_data - 1.96 * se_beta_1_data, \"and\", beta_1_hat_data + 1.96 * se_beta_1_data)\n```\n\nLets confirm this\n\n```{r}\nconfint(lm(y~x,data))\n```\n\nLets plot this confidence interval\n\n```{r}\nlm(y~x,data) %>% \n  dwplot(ci = 0.95,dot_args = list(size=2), vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"grey50\", linetype =2))\n```\n\nSince standard error tells us the range of the $\\beta$ values via confidence interval, we can infer that if this range does not include 0, than our $\\beta$ values are statistically significant; x is assocaited with y.\n\n\nLets do this for `advertising` data as well\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: the 95% confidence interval does not include 0; TV is statistically significant\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  tidy() %>% \n  dwplot(ci = 0.95,dot_args = list(size=2), vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"grey50\", linetype =2))\n```\n\nOr we can use standard erros to perform *hypothesis tests* on the coefficients. We usually don't care about the intercept, so lets do the hypothesis test on only $\\hat{\\beta_1}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nH_0 &: \\beta_1 = 0 \\to \\text{there is no relationship between X and Y} \\\\\nH_1 &: \\beta_1 \\neq 0 \\to \\text{there is some relationship between X and Y}\n\\end{align}\n$$ \nIf the *null-hypothesis* is true =\\> \\$ \\beta\\_1 = 0\\$ =\\> $Y = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon$ =\\> $X$ is not associated with $Y$.\n\nTo test the null-hypothessi, we need to determine whether our estimate $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is sufficiently far from zero that we can be confident that $\\beta_1$ is non-zero. How far is enough? This depends on the accuracy of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$--that is it depends on $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$. If $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ is small, then even relatively small values of $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ may provide strong evidence that $\\beta_1 \\neq 0$. If $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})$ is large, then $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ must be large in absolute value in order for us to reject the null hypothessis. In practice we compute a *t-statistic* given by\n\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_1} - 0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})}\n$$ (3.14)\n\nwhich measures the number of standard deviations that $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ is away from zero. From the t-statistic we can compute the *p-value*; a small p value indicates that it is unlikely to observe such a substantial association between the predictor and the response due to chance, in absence of any real association between the predictor and the response. So if p value is small we infer that there is assocaition between the predictor and the response =\\> we reject the null hypothesis. Typical p-value cutoffs for rejecting the null hypothesis are 5 or 1%. When $n=30$ these correspond to tstatsitcs of around 2 and 2.75.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales~TV,advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  confint() %>% \n  kableExtra::kable(format = \"latex\")\n\n```\n\nHere we see that t statistics are very high, and p values are very low =\\> reject the null hypothesis for both $\\beta$ values; they are statistically significant.\n\n### Assessing the Accuracy of the Model\n\nOnce we concluded the statistically significant variable--rejecting the null hypothesis, we want to quantify *the extend to which the model fits the data*. We can use either\n\n-   *Residual standard error*\n-   $R^2$\n\n*Residual standard error*\n\nRecall from $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i$ that associated with each observation is an error term $\\epsilon$. Because of these error terms even if we knew the true regression line, we would not be able to predict $Y$ from $X$. The *RSE* is an estimate of the standard deviation of $\\epsilon$. It is the average amount that the response will deviate from the true regression line, computed by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{RSE} &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\text{RSS}} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.15)\n\nIn the advertising data, RSE was 3.26; actual sales in each market deviate from the true regression line by approximately 3,269 units, on average. This also means that; if the model were correct and the true values of the unknown coefficients $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ were known exaclty, any predcition of sales on the basis of TV advertising would still be off by about 3,260 units on average. Is this prediction error accaptable? Depends on the data: in the `advertising` data set the mean value of `sales` is $\\approx 14,000$ units, and so the percentage error is $3,260 / 14,000 = 23%$.\n\nThe RSE is considered a measure of the *lack of fit* of the model $Y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon$ to the data. If the predictions from the model are very close to the true outcome values--$\\hat{y_i} \\approx y_i$ then RSE will be small, and we can concldue that the model fits the data very well. Otherwise, if $\\hat{y_i}$ is very far from $y_i$ then RSE may be quite large, indicating the model doesn't fit the data well.\n\n$R^2$**Statistic**\n\nThe RSE provides an absolute measure of lack of fit of the model to the data. $R^2$ provides an alternative measure of fit. It takes the form of a *proportion*--the proportion of variance explained--and so its always $0\\leq R^2 \\leq 1$ and is independent of the scale of $Y$--as opposed to RSE.\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{TSS - RSS}{TSS} = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS}\n$$ (3.17)\n\nwhere $\\text{TSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ is the *total sun of squares* and $\\text{RSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$. TSS measures the total variaance in the response $Y$; and can be thought of as the amount of varaiblity ingerent in the response before the regression is performed. RSS measures the amount of varaiblity that is left unexplained after performing the regression. So TSS - RSS measures the amount of variability in the response that is explained by performing the regression, and $R^2$ measures the *proportion of variability in* $Y$ *that can be explained using* $X$. As $R^2$ gets closer to 1, a large proportion of the variability in the response has been explained by the regression. A number near 0 indicates that the regression did not explain much of the variablity in the response; this might occur because the linear model is wrong, or the inherit error $\\sigma^2 = \\text{RSE}^2$ is high, or both.\n\nLets calculate $R^2$ of our estimation on `advertising` data with the model $\\hat{sales_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}TV_i$\n\n```{r}\nadvertising %>% \n  mutate(sales_hat = beta_0_hat_adv + beta_1_hat_adv * TV) -> advertising\nadvertising\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSS = sum((advertising$sales - advertising$sales_hat)^2)\nRSS\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSE = sqrt(RSS/(length(advertising$sales) -2))\nRSE\n```\n\n```{r}\nTSS = sum((advertising$sales - mean(advertising$sales))^2)\nTSS\n```\n\n```{r}\nR2 = (TSS - RSS) / TSS\nR2\n```\n\n61% of the variablity in `sales` is explained by a linear regression on `TV`.\n\nwhat about our `data`\n\n```{r}\ndata\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSS_data = sum((data$y - data$y_hat)^2)\nRSS_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nRSE_data = sqrt(RSS_data/(length(data$y) -2))\nRSE_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nTSS_data = sum((data$y - mean(data$y))^2)\nTSS_data\n```\n\n```{r}\nR2_data = (TSS_data - RSS_data) / TSS_data\nR2_data\n```\n\n94% of the variablity in `y` is explained by `x`; very good fit of the model.\n\n$R^2$ is better to interpret than RSE.\n\n## Multiple Linear Regression\n\nIn practice we have more than one predictor to explain $Y$.\n\nHow can we extend our analysis of the advertising order to accomodate the other two (`radio` and `newspaper`) additional predictors?\n\n=\\> We can run three separate simple linear regressions, each of which uses a different advertising medium as a predictor:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ radio, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nWe find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on radio advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 203 units.\n\nWe find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on newspaper advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 55 units.\n\nWe find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on TV advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 47 units.\n\n**However** this approach is not good. First of all it is unclear to make a sinlge prediction of sales given levesl of the three advertising media budgets, since each has their own regression equation. Second, each of these three regression equations ignores the other two medi in forming estimates for the regression coefficients. Especially if these media budgets are correalted, this can lead to very misleading estimates of the individaul media effects on sales.\n\nInstead of the seperate linear regressions for each predictor, better approach is to extend the simple linear regression setting $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$ to\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n(3.19)\n\nHere we interpret $B_j$ as the average effect of a one unit increase in $X_j$, *holding all other predictors fixed*.\n\nFor the advertising example;\n\n$$\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TV + \\beta_2 radio + \\beta_3 newspaper + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n### Estimating the Regression Coefficients\n\nAgain, regression coefficients in (3.19) are unknown, and must be estimated from the data. And with these estimates we can make predictions\n\n$$\n\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\hat{\\beta_2}x_2 + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta_p}x_p\n$$ (3.21)\n\nThe parameters are estimated using the same least squares approach with simple linear regression. We choose $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p$ to minimize the sum of squared residuals\n\n\\$\\$ \\begin{align}\n\n\\text{RSS} &= \\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_{i1} - \\beta_2x_{i2} - \\dots - \\beta_px_{ip})^2\n\n\\end{align} \\$\\$ (3.22)\n\n$\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1},\\dots, \\hat{\\beta_p}$ values minimize RSS.\n\nWe are not going to calculate these estimates with our hands, R does that.\n\nLets see our model results with the three predictors.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\n*Interpretation:* for a given amount of Tv and newspaper advertising, spending additional \\$1,000 on radio(TV)(newspaper) advertising leads to an increase in sales approximately by 189(46)(-1) units.\n\nIf we compare these effects with one predictor regressions\n\n> We find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on radio advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 203 units.\n\n> We find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on newspaper advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 55 units.\n\n> We find that on average, \\$1,000 increase in spending on TV advertising is associated with an increase in sales by around 47 units.\n\nFor tv and radio coefficients are similar, but for **newspaper**: from the simple linear regression coefficient of newspaper was significant, but in multiple linear regression it is not; p value is very high.\n\n```{r}\nconfint(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nIts confidence interval contains 0.\n\nThis difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression coefficients stems from the fact that in the simple regression, the slope term represents the average effet of a one dollar increase in newspaper advertising, ignoring other preditors such as tv and radio. In contrsat, in the multiple regression setting, the coefficient for newspaper represents the average effect of increeasing newapper spending by one dollar, while holding tv and radio fixed.\n\nDoes it make sense for the multiple regression to suggest no relationship between sales and newspaper while the simple linear regression implies the opposite? Yes!\n\nTake a look at this correlation matrix:\n\n```{r}\ncor(advertising[1:4])\n```\n\nWe can also make it a plot out of this:\n\n```{r}\ncorrplot(cor(advertising[1:4]), method = \"number\")\n```\n\nNotice that correlation between radio and newspaper is 0.35. This reveals a tendency to spend more on newspaper advertising in markets where more is spent on radio advertising. Now suppose the multiple regression is correct and newspaper advertising has no direct impact on sales, but radio advertising does increase sales. Then in markets where we spend more on radio, our sales will tend to be higher, adn as our correaltion matrix shows, we also tend to spend more on newspaper advertising in those same markets. Hence, in a simple linaer regresion which only examines sales vs newspaper, we will observe that higher values of newspaper tend to be associated with higher values of sales, even though newspaper advertising does not actually affect sales. So newspaper sales are proxy for radio advertising; newspaper gets credit for the effect of radio on sales.\n\nThis is a very common issue. Consider running a regression of shark attack versus ice cream sales for data collected at a given beach community. We would see a positive relationship, similar to that seen between sales and newspaper. Of course ice creams doesnt cause shark attacks. In reality higher temperatures cause more people to visit the beach in trun results in more ice cream sales and more shark attacks. A multiple regression of attacks versus ice cream sales and temperature revals that, the former predictr is no longer significant after adjusting for temperature.\n\n### Some important Questions\n\nWhen we perform MLR, we usually are interested answering a few important questions\n\n1.  *Is at least one of the predictors* $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p$ *useful in predicting the response?*\n\n2.  *Do all predictors help to explain* $Y$, *or is only a subset of the predictors useful?*\n\n3.  *How well does the model fit the data?*\n\n4 *Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict, and how accurate is our prediction?*\n\nLets answer these questions:\n\n1.  *Is at least one of the predictors* $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p$ *useful in predicting the response?*\n\n    In SLR we simply checked whether $\\beta_1 = 0$ or not. In MLR, we need to ask whether all of the regression coefficients are zero $\\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\dots = \\beta_p = 0$. So our null hypothesis is\n\n    $$\n     \\begin{align}\n     H_0 &: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\dots = \\beta_o = 0 \\\\\n     H_\\alpha &: \\text{at least one} \\space B_j \\space \\text{is non-zero}\n     \\end{align}\n     $$ This hypothesis test is performed by computing the *F-statistic*,\n\n    $$\n     F = \\frac{(TSS - RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\n     $$ (3.23)\n\n    So, if there is no relationship between the resposne and predictors, we expect F-statistic to take on value close to 1. if $H_\\alpha$ is true then $F$ should be greater than 1.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nF statistic is 570 and is far from 1. But it is best to have a look at the p-value of the F statistic which is also very small.\n\nThis means that at least one of the media is associated with increase sales.\n\nIn (3.23) we are testing $H_0$ that all the coefficients are zero. Sometimes we want to test that a particular subset of $q$ of the coefficients are zero. This corresponesd to a null hypothesis\n\n$$\n  H_0 : \\beta_{p-q+1} = \\beta_{p-q+2} = \\dots = \\beta_p\n  $$\n\nIn this case we fit a second model that uses all the variables *except* those last $q$. suppose that residual sum of squares for that model is $RSS_0$. Then the appropriate F-statistic is\n\n$$\n  F = \\frac{(RSS_0 - RSS)/q}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\n  $$ (3.24)\n\nOn advertising MLR we saw that newspaper is not significant from its p value. Then why do we need to look at the overall F-statistic? after all, it seems likely that if any one of the p-values for the individual variables is very small, then *at least one of the predictors is realted to the respose*. This is not true usually, especially when $p$ is large.\n\nSo after estimating the model first look at the F-statistic, than to the individual t statistic p values.\n\n2.  *Do all predictors help to explain* $Y$, *or is only a subset of the predictors useful?* =\\> **Deciding on important variables**\n\n    After lookig at the F statistic, we can look at the individual p values. But if \\*p\\$ is large, we are going to make false discoveries.\n\n    Usually not all predictors are associated with the response. This task of determining which predictors are associated with the response in order to fit a single model involving only those predictors is refered to as *variable selection*. Check out Chapter 6 for more detail. But here is a breif outline of some of the classical approaches.\n\n    Ideally we want to perform variable selection by trying out a lot of different models, each containing different subset of the predictors. For instance if our $p=2$ then we can consider four models\n\n    -   \n\n        (1) a model containing no variables\n\n    -   \n\n        (2) a model containing $x_1$ only\n\n    -   \n\n        (3) a model containnig $x_2$ only\n\n    -   \n\n        (4) a model containing $x1$ and $x_2$.\n\n    We can then select the *best* model out of all the models by looking at some statistics we can use to judge the quality of the model. These are\n\n    -   *Mallow*'s $C_p$\n    -   *Akaike information creterion* (AIC)\n    -   *Bayesian information criterion*(BIC)\n    -   *adjusted* $R^2$\n\n    These are discussed in more detail in chapter 6.\n\n    We can also determine which model is the best by plotting various model outputs, such as the residuals, in order to search for patterns.\n\n    But we cannot consider all models, especially when $p$ is high. There are three classical approaches for this task:\n\n    -   *Forward selection*\n        -   begin with *null model* a model that contains an intercept but no predictors.\n\n        -   Then fit *p* simple linear regressions and add to the null model the variable that results in the lowest RSS.\n\n        -   Then add to that model the variable that results in the lowest RSS for the new two-variable model. This approach is continued until some stopping rule is satisfied.\n    -   *Backward selection*\n        -   Put all varaibles in the model.\n        -   remove the least statistically significant predictor.\n        -   estimate the new regression with $p-1$ variable, remove the largest p-value predictor. This procedure continues until a stopping rule is reached =\\> stop after all remaining variables have p value \\< 0.02\n    -   *Mixed selection*\n        -   Combination of forward selection and backward selection\n        -   Start with no variables in the model\n        -   add the varaible that provides the best fit\n        -   add varaibles one-by-one\n        -   at one point if the p-value for one of the variables in the model rises above a certain treshold, then we remove that variabel from the model.\n        -   Continue untill all variables have sufficiently low p value, and all vairables in the model woudl have a large p-value if added to the model\n\n    Backwar slecetion cannot be used if $p>n$, forward selection can always be used.\n\n3.  *How well does the model fit the data?* **Model Fit**\n\nTwo of the most common numerical measures of model fit are RSE and $R^2$.\n\nIn SLR $R^2$ is equal to $cor(Y,X)$. In MLR $R^2 = cor(Y,\\hat{Y})$.\n\n$R^2$ will always increase as you add more variable, even though that varaible is not statistically significant. This is because adding another variable must allow us to fit the trainig data(not necessarly test data) more accurately. But this increase in $R^2$ after adding a statistically not-significant varible is very low =\\> evidence that you can drop the not significant variable. Check out the $R^2$ variables of the following models\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising))\n```\n\nThey are almost the same.\n\nBut lets see the $R^2$ of the model containing only Tv\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, advertising))\n```\n\nit is 0.611.\n\nIf we add radio\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising))\n```\n\nIt increaes dramatically. This implies that model that uses TV and radio to predict sales is better than only using Tv. also radio is statistically signifiacnt.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nNot with newspaper though.\n\nOr the opposite\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ radio, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales~radio+TV, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nWhat about RSE:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n```\n\nadding newspaper increased the RSE =\\> no need to add newspaper. Adding newspaper increases RSE because\n\n$$\nRSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-p-1}RSS}\n$$\n\nModels with more variables can have higher RSE if the decrease in RSS is small relative to the increase in $p$.\n\nSo we can look at both the RSE and $R^2$.\n\n**Four: Predictions**\n\nAfter fitting the model we can predict $Y$ =\\> $\\hat{y}$ with estimated coefficients. However, there are three sorts of uncertainty associated with this prediction:\n\n1.  The coefficient esstimates $\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1},\\dots,\\hat{\\beta_p}$ are estimates for $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p$:\n\n    That is, the *least squares plane*\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\dots +  \\hat{\\beta_p}x_p\n$$\n\nwhich is only an estimate for the *true population regression plane* $$\nf(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\n$$\n\nSo there is an inaccuracy in the coefficient estimates =\\> this is the *reducible error* from Chapter 2. We can compute a *confidence interval* to determine how close $\\hat{y}$ will be to $f(X)$.\n\n2.  Assuming a linear model for $f(X)$ is almost always an aaproximation of reality (usually relationships are not linear), so ther is an additional source of potentially reducible error =\\> this is the *model bias*.\n\n    When we are using a linear model, we are in fact estimating the best linear approximation to the true surface. However, we will ignore this discrepancy and operate as if the linear model is correct\n\n3.  Even if we knew $f(X)$--that is even if we knew the true values of $\\beta$--the response value cannot be predicted perfectly because of the random error $\\epsilon$ in the model =\\> *irreducable error*. How much will $Y$ vary from $\\hat{y}$ =\\> we use *prediction intervals* to answer this question.\n\n    Predicion intervals are always wider than confidence intervals, because they contain both the *reducible error*(error from estimating coefficients of $f(X)$) and irreducible error.\n\nWe use a *confidence interval* to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the *average* `sales` over a large number of cities. For example given that \\$100,000 is spent on `TV` advertising and \\$20,000 is spent on `radio` advertising in each city, the 95% confidence interval is $[10,985, 11,528]$. We interpret this to mean that 95% of intervals of this form will contain the true value of $f(X)$.\n\nOn the other hand, *a prediction interval* can be used to quantify the uncertainty surrounding `sales` for a *particular* city. Given that \\$100,000 is spent on `TV` advertising and \\$20,000 is spent on `radio` advertising in that city the 95% prediction interval is $[7,930, 14,580]$. We interpret this to mean that 95% of intervals of this form will contain the true value of $Y$ for this city. Note that both intervals are centered at 11,256, but that the prediction intervaş is substantially wider than the confidence interval, reflecting the increased uncertainty about `sales` for a given city in comparison to the average `sales` over many locations.\n\n## Other Considerations in the Regression Model\n\n### Qualitative Predictors\n\nIn practice not all variables are *quantitative*; some predictors are *qualitative*.\n\nCheck out the `Credit` data set\n\n```{r}\nCredit = read.csv(\"./data/Credit.csv\") %>% as_tibble\nCredit\n```\n\nLets do a scatterplot of all variables\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Fig 3.6 The credit data set contains infortmation about blaance, age, cards, education income, limit and rating for a number of potential customers\nCredit %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% pairs(.)\n```\n\n**Predictors with Only Two Levels**\n\nWe want to investigate differences in credit card balance between maels and females, ignoring other variables for the moment. If a qualitative predictors (also known as *factor*) only has two *levels*, then incorporating it into a regression model is very simple. We create a *dummy variable* that takes on two possible *numerical* values. For example based on `Gender` varaible, we can create a new varaible that takes the form\n\n$$\nx_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is female} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is male}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.26)\n\nand use this variable as a predictor in the regression equation. This results in the model\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is female} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i & i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is male}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.27)\n\nNow $\\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the average credit card balance among males, $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ as the average credit card among females, and $\\beta_1$ as the average difference in credit card balance between females and males.\n\nHere is the regression results:\n\n```{r}\nCredit$Gender <- factor(Credit$Gender, levels = c(\" Male\",\"Female\"))\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Gender, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nR converts all *\"Female\"* values to 1 automatically. If we were to do this manually\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  mutate(Gender = as.character(Gender)) %>% \n  mutate(Gender = ifelse(Gender == \"Female\",1,0)) %>% \n  lm(Balance ~ Gender, .) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThis means that average credit card debt for males is estimated to be \\$509.80, whereas females are estimated to carry \\$19.73 in additional debt for a total of $\\$509.80 + \\$19.73 = \\$529.53$. However, the coefficient of the dummy variable is not significant; there is no statistical evidence of a difference in average credit card balance between the genders.\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=Gender, y =Balance, fill = Gender) + geom_boxplot(show.legend = F) + geom_point(data =(Credit %>% group_by(Gender) %>% summarise(Balance = mean(Balance))),shape = 4, show.legend = F) + theme_clean()\n```\n\nThe desicion to code females as 1 and males as 0 in (3.27) is arbitrary, and has no effect on the regression fit, but does alter the interpretation of the coefficients. If we had coded males as 1 and females as 0:\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  mutate(Gender = factor(Gender, levels = c(\"Female\", \" Male\"))) %>% \n  lm(Balance ~ Gender,.) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThen we would say that estimated average debt for females is \\$529.54, and for males is $\\$529.52 - \\$19.73 = \\$509.80$.\n\nAlternatively, instead of 0/1 coding scheme, we could create a dummy variable\n\n$$\nx_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is female} \\\\\n-1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is male}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ and use this variable in the regression equation. This results in the model\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is female} \\\\\n\\beta_0 - \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is male} \n\\end{cases}\n$$ Now $\\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the overall average credit card balance (ignoring the gender effect), and $\\beta_1$ is the amount that females are above the average and males are below the average.\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% \n  mutate(Gender = as.character(Gender)) %>% \n  mutate(Gender = ifelse(Gender == \"Female\",1,-1)) %>% \n  lm(Balance ~ Gender,.) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nNow $\\beta_0$ is \\$ 519.670 which is the halfway between the male and female averages of \\$509.80 and \\$529.53. The estimate for $\\beta_1$ is \\$9.865, which is half of \\$19.74, the average difference between females and males.\n\n**Qualitative Predictors with More than Two levels**\n\nIn this case we need to create an additional dummy. For example have a look at the `Ethnicity` variable\n\n```{r}\nCredit %>% select(Ethnicity) %>% unique()\n```\n\nHas three possible values. Then we need to create two dummies\n\n$$\nx_{i1} = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Asian} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is not Asian} \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nx_{i2} = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Caucasian} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is not Caucasian} \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThen both these varaibles can be used in the regression equation, in order to obtain the model\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\beta_2x_{i2} + \\epsilon_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Asian} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is Caucasian} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th}\\space \\text{person is African American} \n\\end{cases}\n$$ Now $\\beta_0$ can be interpreted as the average credit card balance for African Americans, $\\beta_1$ can be interpreted as the difference in the average balance between Asian and African american categories, and $\\beta_2$ can be interpreted as the difference in average balance between the Caucasian and African American categories.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Ethnicity, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThere will always be one fewer dummy variable than the number of levels. The level with no dummy variable--African American in this example--is known as the *baseline*.\n\nFrom the regression results we see that the estimated `balance` for the baseline, African American, is \\$531.00. It is estimated that Asian category will have \\$18.69 less debt than the African American category on average, and the Caucasian category will have \\$12.50 less debt that the African American category. However, p-values associated with the coefficient estimates for the two dummy variables are very large, suggesting no statistical evidence of a real difference in credit card balance between the ethnicities. The coefficients will change bassed on the baseline and coding.\n\nRather than relying on the individual coefficients, we can use F-test to test $H_0 : \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = 0$; this does not depend on the coding. The F-test has a p-value of 0.9575, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between `balance` and `ethnicity`.\n\nUsing this dummy variable approach presents no difficulties when using both quantitative and qualitative predictors. For example, to regress `balance` on both a quantitative varaible such as `income` and a qualitative variable such as `student`, we must simply create a dummy varaible for `student` and then fit a multiple linear regression model using `income` and the dummy variable as the predictors for credit card balance.\n\n### Extensions of the Linear Model\n\nLinear regression model is very interpretable and works quite well on many real-world problems. However, it makes several highly restrictive assumptions that are ofthen violated in practice. Two of them ost important assumptions state that the relationship between the predictors and response are *additive* and *linear*.\n\nThe *additive* assumption means that the effect of changes in a predictor $x_j$ on the response $Y$ is independent of the vlaues of the other predictors.\n\nThe *linear* assumption means thatt the change in the response $Y$ due to one-unit change in $x_j$ is constant, regardless of the vlaue of $x_j$.\n\nWe can relax these assumptions. Here some classical approaches to do that\n\n**Removing the Additive Assumption**\n\nFrom `Advertising` data, we concluded that both `TV` and `radio` seem to be associated with `sales`. Our model was linear; the effect of `TV` and `radio` advertising spending on sales is independent of each other, and their effect is constant no matter the level of spending.\n\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TV_i + \\beta_2 radio_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$ this model means that, the average effect on sales of a one unit increase in tv is always $\\beta_1$ regardless of the amount spent on radio.\n\nHowever, this simple model may be incorrect. Suppose that spending money on radio advertising actually increases the effectiveness of TV advertising, so that the slope term for `TV` should increase as `radio` increases. In this situation, given a fixed budget \\$100,000, spending half on `radio` and half on `TV` may increase `sales` more than allocating the entire amount to either `TV` or to `radio`. In marketing this is known as the *synergy effect*, in statistics *interaction effect*.\n\nConsider the standard linear regression with two variables,\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\epsilon\n$$ Here if we increaes $x_1$ by one unit, $Y$ will increase by an average of $\\beta_1$ units. The presence of $x_2$ does not alter this statement-regardless of the value of $x_2$, a one-unit increase in $x_1$ will lead to $\\beta_1$ unit increae in $Y$.\n\nWe can extend this model by allowing interaction effects by including a third predictor, called an *interaction term*, which is constructed by computing the product of $x_1$ and $x_2$:\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \\epsilon\n$$ (3.31)\n\nWe can write this equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nY &= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 x_2)x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 +\\epsilon \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + \\tilde{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n$$ where $\\tilde{\\beta_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3x_2$. Since $\\tilde{\\beta_1}$ changes with $x_2$, the effect of $x_1$ on $Y$ is no longer constant: adjusting $x_2$ will change the impact of $x_1$ on $Y$.\n\n::: callout-note\n# Productivy of a factory\n\nSuppose that we are interested in studying the productivity of a factory. We want to predict the number of `units` produced on the basis of the number of production `lines` and the total number of `workers`. Probably the effect of increasing `lines` on `units` produced will depend on the number of `workers`, since if no workers are available to operate the lines, then increasing the number of lines will not increase the production. This suggest to include an interaction term between `lines` and `workers` in a linear model to predict `units`.\n\nSuppose when we fit the model, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nunits &\\approx 1.2 + 3.4 \\times lines + 0.22 \\times workers + 1.4 \\times (lines \\times workers) \\\\\n&= 1.2 + (3.4 + 1.4 \\times workers) \\times lines + 0.22 \\times workers\n\\end{align}\n$$ Adding an addtional line will increase the number of units produced by $3.4 + 1.4 \\times workers$. Hence, the more `workers` we have, the stronger will be the effect of `lines`.\n:::\n\nFor the advitising, a linear model that uses `radio`, `TV` and interaction between the two to predict `sales` takes the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nsales &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV + \\beta_2 \\times radio + \\beta_3 \\times(radio \\times TV) + \\epsilon \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 \\times radio)\\times Tv + \\beta_2 \\times radio + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n$$ (3.33) We can interpret $\\beta_3$ as the increase in the effectiveness of TV advertising for a one unit increse in radio advertising (or vice versa). The coefficients that result from fitting the model (3.33) are\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio + TV*radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nAdding the interaction term increased the $R^2$ significantly from 0.8972 to 0.9678, RSE from 1.681 to 0.9435.\n\nThe p-value for the interaction term is very low; $H_\\alpha : \\beta_3 \\neq 0$. This means that the relationship is not additive.\n\nTo interpret the coefficients:\n\n\\$1,000 increse in `TV` advertising results with $\\hat{\\beta_1} +\\hat{\\beta_3}\\times radio = \\$19.1 + \\$1.09 \\times radio$ increase in sales on average.\n\n\\$1,000 invrease in `radio` advertising results with $\\hat{\\beta_2} + \\hat{\\beta_3} \\times TV = \\$28.9 + \\$1.09 \\times TV$ increase in sales on average.\n\nAll p-values are significant =\\> all three varibles should be included in the model.\n\nSometimes interaction term has a very small pvalue but the associated main effects(in this case `TV` and `radio`) do not. The *hieararchial principle states that if we include an interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects, even if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not significant.*\n\nHere both our varaibles were quantitative. However, the consept of interaction applies to qualitative varaibles, or combination of qualitative and quantitative varibles. Actually interaction between a quantitative and qualitative variable has a particularly nice interpreateion:\n\nConsider the `Credit` data set. Suppose we want to predict `balance` using `income`(quantitative) and `student`(qualitative) varaibles. In the absence of an interaction term the model takes the form\n\n$$\nbalance_i  \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times income_i + \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_2 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is not student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$$\nbalance_i = \\beta_1 \\times income + \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student} \\\\\n\\beta_0 &\\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.34)\n\nNotice that this amounts to fitting two parallel lines to the data, one for students and one for non-students. The lines for students and non students have different intercepts, $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2$ versus $\\beta_0$, but the slope $\\beta_1$ is the same.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Income + Student, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nAverage Non student balance is \\$211.1430; students have \\$382.6705 more balance on average compared to non students. \\$1,000 increase in income increases balance by \\$5,984 on average. All coefficients are statistically significant. $R^2 = 0.2775$\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\nCredit %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(y=Balance, x=Income) + geom_point(shape =NA) + geom_abline(intercept = 211.1430, slope = 5.9843, color = \"black\", size=1.2) + geom_abline(intercept = 593.8135, slope = 5.9843, color = \"darkred\", size= 1.2) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,150), ylim=c(200,1400)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1400,400)) + theme_clean() + geom_text(data = tibble(x = c(80,80), y =c(1130,640), z = c(\"Student\",\"non-student\")), inherit.aes = F, aes(x=x, y=y, label=z), angle=25.9) -> p1\np1\n```\n\nNotice the since the slopes are same, two lines are parallel; average effect of income on balance does not depend on whether or not the individual is a student. This is a limitation; change in income may have a very different effect on the credit card balance of a student versus non student.\n\nThis limitation can be addressed by adding an interaction varaible, created by multiplying `student` and `income` with the dummy for student. Our model now becomes\n\n$$\nbalance_i \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times income_i + \n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 \\times income_i & \\text{if student} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if not student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ $$\nbalance_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n(\\beta_0 + \\beta_2) + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) \\times income_i & \\text{if student} \\\\\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times income_i & \\text{if not student}\n\\end{cases}\n$$ (3.35)\n\nAgain, our intercepts differ based on whether individual is student or not. However, this time slope also differs!\n\nLets estimate this model\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Income + Student + Income * Student, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\nThis results in\n\n```{r}\ntibble(\n  intercept = c(200.6232, 200.6232+476.6758),\n  income = c(6.2182, 6.2182 - 1.9992),\n  type = c(\"Non-student\", \"student\")\n)\n```\n\nand becomes\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\nCredit %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x = Income, y = Balance) + geom_point(shape =NA)+\n  geom_abline(intercept = 201, slope = 6.22, color = \"black\", size =1.2) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 677, slope = 4.22, size = 1.2, color = \"darkred\") +  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,150), ylim=c(200,1400)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1400,400)) + theme_clean() + geom_text(data = tibble(x = c(80,80), y =c(1130,640), z = c(\"Student\",\"non-student\")), inherit.aes = F, aes(x=x, y=y, label=z), angle=25.9) -> p2\np2\n```\n\nLets merge this two plots together\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2, ncol =2)\n```\n\nSlope for studens is lower than the slope for non-students =\\> increases in income are associated with smaller increases in credit card balance among students as copared to non-students.\n\n**Not-linear Relationships**\n\nLinear model assumes linear relationship between the response and the predictors. However, this is often not true. We can relax this assumption using *polynomial regression*.\n\nConsider `Auto`\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: linear regresion fit is in orange, blue curve is a linear regression fit for a model that includes horsepower^2, and green curve includes up to horsepower^5\nAuto %>% as_tibble() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=horsepower, y = mpg) + geom_point(shape =1, size =1.4) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F, color =\"#FEBF63\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,2), color =\"#7FDBDA\", se = F) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ poly(x,5), color =\"#ADE498\", se=F) + theme_blank() \n```\n\nIt is obvious that there is relationship between `mpg` and `horsepower`. But it seems like this relationship is not linear: the data suggest a curved relationship.\n\nA simple approach for incorporating non linear associations in a linear model is to include transformed versions of the predictors in the model. For example figure above seem to have a *quadratic* shape, suggesting that a model of the form\n\n$$\nmpg = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times horsepower + \\beta_2 \\times horsepower^2 + \\epsilon\n$$ May be a better fit. Equation\n\nYou can do it in different ways: 1.\n\n```{r}\nAuto %>% \n  mutate(hp.sq = horsepower^2) %>% \n  lm(mpg~horsepower + hp.sq,.) %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\n2.  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), Auto))\n```\n\n3.  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower,2, raw=T), Auto))\n```\n\n4.  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(nls(mpg ~a + b * horsepower + c * horsepower^2, data = Auto, start = c(a=0,b=0,c=0)))\n```\n\n--\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto))\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2),Auto))\n```\n\nThe $R^2$ of the quadratic fit is 0.688, compared to 0.606 for the linear fit. And the p-value is highly significant for quadratic model.\n\nIf adding $horsepower^2$ increses the $R^2$ why not include $^3$ or $^4$ or more?\n\nLets estimate the green curve on the previous plot\n\n```{r}\nsummary(lm(horsepower ~ poly(horsepower,5, raw=T),Auto))\n```\n\nThe green fit seems unnecassasrliy wiggly- that is it is unclear includig the additional terms really has led to a better fit to the data.\n\nThe approach we have just described for extending the linear model to accomodate non-linear relationships is known as *polynomial regression*, since we have included polynomial functions of the predictors in the regression model. Check out Chapter 7.\n\n### Potential Problems\n\nWhen we fit a linear regression model to a particular data set, many problems may occur. Most common among these are the following\n\n1.  *Non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships*.\n\n2.  *Correalation of error terms*\n\n3.  *Non-constant variance of error terms*\n\n4.  *Outliers*\n\n5.  *High-leverage points*\n\n6.  *Collinearity*\n\nLets breifly discuss each\n\n**1.Non-linearity of the Data**\n\nLinear regression assumes there is a straight line relationship between the predictors and the respose. If the true relationship is far from linear, then our estimations are not good. Also our prediction accuracy is reduced.\n\n*Residual plots* are a useful graphical tool for identifying non-linearity.\n\nWe can plot the residuals $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i}$ versus $x_i$ for Simple linear regression.\n\nFor multiple linear regression since we have lost of $x_i$ we plot residuals versus predicted values($e_i$ vs $\\hat{y_i}$).\n\nWe want to have *no visible pattern*. If there is a pattern =\\> problem!\n\nSo what do we expect a plot of \"fitted\" vs \"resid\"; if the relationship is linear as the \"fitted\" values increase \"resid\" should not increase or decrease, should swing with no relationship: linear.\n\nIf the relationship is not linear then we expect ot see a pattern because as the fitted values increase the resiudls will increase.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() \n```\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=horsepower, y = .resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + theme_light()\n```\n\nHere we observe a U-shape trend; indicating non-linear relationship between `horsepower` and `mpg`.\n\nLets do a plot of fitted vs residual for linear and non linear regression:\n\n```{r}\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") + theme_light()\n,\n\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), Auto) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") + theme_light(), ncol=2)\n```\n\nHere is the plots. On the left fitted vs resid for regressing horsepower onto mpg, on the right regressing horsepower and horsepower\\^2 onto mpg.\n\nBlue line is a smooth fit to the residuals to identify trends easily. The residuals on the left panel exhibit a clear U shape, which is a strong indication that the true relationship is not linear.\n\nRight hand panel displays a little pattern, suggesting that the quadratic term improves the fit to the data.\n\nIf the residual plot indicates that there are non-linear associations in the data, then a simple approach is to use non-linear transformations of the predictors, such as $\\log X$, $\\sqrt{X}$, and $X^2$, in the regression model. We will discuss more later on.\n\n**2.Correlation of Error Terms**\n\nAn important assumption of the linear regression is that error terms $\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\dots, \\epsilon_n$ are uncorrelated. This means that $\\epsilon_{i+1} \\neq f(\\epsilon_i)$. The standard errors that are computed for the estimated regression coeffieints or the fitted values are based on this assumption. If there is correaltion among the error terms, the estimated standard errors will tend to underestimate the true standard errors =\\> confidence and prediction intervals will be narrower than they should be. P-values will be lower as well, causing false discoveries perhaps.\n\nUsually correlation among error terms occur in *time series* data. In many cases, observations that are obtained at adjacent time points will have positevely correalated errors. To test this we can plot the residuals from our model as a function of time. If the errors are uncorrelated, then we expect no pattern. If the error terms are positevly correlated, then we may see *tracking* in the residuals--*adjacent residuals may have similar values*.\n\n![](fig3.10.png) Check out Figure 3.10. In the top panel, we see the residuals from a linear regression fit to data generated with uncorrelated errors. Adjacent years don't take similar values; there is no evidence of a time-related trend in the residuals. But in the bottom panel, we see plotted residuals which have correlation 0.9 with time: now there is a clear pattern in the residuals--adjacent residuals tend to take on similar values. Finally, the center panel illustrates a more moderate case in which residuals had a correlation of 0.5. There is still evidence of tracking, but the pattern is less clear.\n\nCorrelation among the error terms can also occur outside of time series data. For instance, consider a study where we predict people's hights from their weights. The assumption of uncorrelated errors could be violated if some of the individauls in the study are members of the same family, or eat the same diet, or have been exposed to same environmental factors.\n\n**3.Non-constant Variance of Error Terms**\n\nAnother important assumption of the linear regression model is that error terms have a constant variance, $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2$. The standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests rely upon this assumption.\n\nUnfortunately, often variances of the error terms are non-constant =\\> *heteroscedasticity*. For instance, variances of the error terms may increase with the value of the response. We can identify non-constant variances in the errors from the presence of a *funnel shape* in the residual plot.\n\n![](fig3.11.png) On the left panel magnitude of the residuals tends to increase with the fitted values. When faced with this problem, one possible solution is to transform the response $Y$ using a concave function such as $\\log Y$ or $\\sqrt{Y}$. Such a transformation results in a greater amount of shrinkage of the larger responses, leading to a reduction in heteroscedasticity. On the right hand panel we see that residuals apper to have constant variance.\n\n**4.Outliers**\n\nAn *outlier* is a point for which $y_i$ is far from the vlaue predicted by the model.\n\n![](fig3.12.png)\n\nThe red point (observation 20) in the left-hand panel of Figure 3.12 illustrates a typical outlier. The red solid line is the least squares regression fit, while the blue dashed line is the least squares fit after removel of the outlier. In this case, removing the outlier has little effect on the least squares line: it leads to almost no change in the slope, and a minuscule reduction in the intercept. This is normal. However, it can cause other problems: RSE is 1.09 when outlier is included, but it is only 0.77 when excluded =\\> RSE is used to calculate all confidence intervals, p values =\\> bias. $R^2$ also decreases from 0.829 to 0.805 when included outlier.\n\nResidual plots can be used to identify outliers =\\> center panel of Figure 3.12. But it can be difficult to decide how large a residual needs to before we consider the point to be an outlier. To address this problem instead of plotting the residuals we can plot the *studentized residuals* computed by dividing each residuls $e_i$ by its estimated standard error.\n\n$$\ne_i^*=\\frac{e_i}{sd(e_i)} = \\frac{e_i}{\\sqrt{MSE(1-h_{ii})}}\n$$ $h_{ii}$ is leverage point.\n\nObservations whose studentized residuals are greater than 3 in absolute value are possible outliers. In the right-hand panel of Figure 3.12 the outlier's studentized residual exceeds 6; while all other observations have studentized residauls between -2 and 2.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales~TV + radio,advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment() %>% \n  mutate(.std.resid_3 = ifelse(abs(.std.resid) >=3,T,F), id = 1:200) %>% \n  print %>% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y =.std.resid, color = .std.resid_3) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\",\"red\")) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(.std.resid_3 == T,id,\"\")), nudge_x = 0.5, show.legend = F)+ theme_light() \n```\n\nor\n\n```{r}\nplot(lm(sales ~ TV + radio,advertising), which = 3)\n```\n\nWe have spotted that 6th and 131 are possible outliers.\n\nHere is all the data regression result:\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  car::outlierTest()-> outs\nouts # 131th value is outlier\n```\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  car::outlierTest(., cutoff = 0.30)\n```\n\n\nHere is regression result after removing outliers\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising[-c(6,131),]) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  summary()\n```\n\n$R^2$ has increased, residual standard errors has decreased, standard errors of estimates decreased and coefficients has changed.\n\n**5.High Leverage Points**\n\nOutliers are observations for which the response $y_i$ is unusual given the predictor $x_i$. In contrast, observations with *high leverage* have an unusual value for $x_i$.\n\n![](fig3.13.png)\n\nFor example observation 41 in the left-hand panel of Figure 3.13 has high leverage =\\> predictor value for this observation is large relative to other observations. The red solid line is the least squares fit to the data, the blue dashed line is the fit when obs 41 is removed.\n\nRemoving the high leverage observation has a much more substantial impact on the least squares line than removing an outlier. High leverage obss have a big impact on the estiamted regression line. It is important to identify them.\n\nFor SLR =\\> look at the range of $x_i$ and spot the out of range observations.\n\nMLR =\\> it is possible to have an observation that is well within the range of each individual predictor's values, but that is unusual in terms of the full set of predictors.\n\nHave a look at the center panel in Figure 3.13. Most of the observations' predictor values fall within the blue dashed ellipse, but the red observation is well outside of this range. But neither its value for $x_1$ nor $x_2$ is unusual.\n\nWe can quantify an observation's leverage using the *leverage statistic*. A large value indicates a high leverage.\n\nFor SLR:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nh_i &= \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{i'=1}^n(x_{i'} - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\\n&1/n \\leq h_i \\leq 1 \\\\\n&\\bar{h_i} = (p+1)/n\n\\end{align}\n$$ as $x_i$ increases its distance from $\\bar{x}$ $h_i$ increases.\n\n$h_i$ is always between $1/n$ and $1$, and the average leverage for all the observations is always equal to $(p+1)/n$. If an observation has a $h$ that greatly exceeds $(p+1)/n$ then we may suspect of high leverage.\n\nRight hand panel of Figure 3.13 shows studentized residuals versus $h_i$. Obs 41 stands out as having a very high leverage statistic as well as a high studentized residual =\\> It is an outlier as well as a high leverage observaiton. This is very dangerous. This plot also shows the reason that obs 20 had relatively little effect on the least sqaures fit in Figure 3.12: it has low leverage.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  augment()\n```\n\nleverages are shown in `.hat` here.\n\n```{r}\nplot(lm(sales~TV,advertising), which = 5)\n```\n\n**6.Collinearity**\n\n*Collinearity* refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables are closely related to one another.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Figure 3.14\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\n  Credit %>% ggplot() + aes(x=Limit, y = Age) + geom_point(color =\"red\", alpha =0.4),\n  Credit %>% ggplot() + aes(x=Limit, y= Rating) + geom_point(color =\"red\", alpha = 0.4),\n  ncol=2\n)\n```\n\nIn the left panel of Figure 3.14 we see no relationship, but on the right hand panel predicors are highly correlated: they are *collinear* =\\> it is difficult to seperate out the individual effects of colliniar varaibles on the response.\n\nCollinearity reduces the accuracy of the estiamtes of the regression coefficients, it causes the standard error for $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ to grow. t-statistic for each predictor is calculated by dividing $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ by its standard error =\\> collinearity declines the t-statistics =\\> we may fail to reject $H_0:\\beta_j = 0$.\n\nLets do two regressions:\n\n-   model1: balance regressed onto age and limit which has no collinearity\n-   model2: balance regressed onto rating and limit which are collinear.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Age + Limit, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  tidy() %>% mutate(model = 1) %>% \n  bind_rows(\n    linear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Rating + Limit, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  tidy() %>% mutate(model =2)\n  )\n```\n\nIn the first model both `age` and `limit` are statistically significant. In the second, collinearity between `limit` and `raiting` has caused standard error for the limit coefficient estimate to increase by a factor of 12 and p-value to increase to 0.701. The importance of the limit variable has been masked due to presence of collinearity.\n\nA simple way to detect collinearity is to look at the correlation matrix of the predictors. Correlation matrix shows the relatinship of two variables but, it is possible for colşinearty to exist between three or more varaibles even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation. This situation is called *multicollinaerity*.\n\nInstead of inspecting the correlatino matrix, better way to assess multicollinaerity is to compute the *variance inflation factor* (VIF). The VIF is the raio of the variance of $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ when fitting the model divided by the variance of $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ if fit on its own.\n\n$$\n1 \\leq VIF\n$$ Smallest possible value of VIF is 1: complete absence of collinearity. Usuall there is always some degree of collinearity among the predictors. A VIF that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinaerity.\n\nThe VIF for each vairable can be computed using the formula\n\n$$\nVIF(\\hat{\\beta_j}) = \\frac{1}{1-R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}}\n$$ $R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}$ is the $R^2$ from a regression of $x_j$ onto all of the other predictors. If $R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}$ is close to one, then collinearity is present, so VIF will be large.\n\n```{r}\nlinear_reg() %>% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %>% \n  fit(Balance ~ Age + Rating + Limit, Credit) %>% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %>% \n  car::vif() \n```\n\nA regression of balance on age, rating, and limit indicates that the predictors have VIF Values of 1.01, 160.67, 160.59. There is considerable collinearity in the data.\n\nWhen faced with collinearity, two simple solutions exist: \\* drop one of the problematic variables from the regression \\* combine collinear variables together into a single predictor. We might take the average of standardized versions of limit and rating in order to create a new varaible that measures *credit worthiness*.\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising) %>% summary()\n```\n\n\nTo get a anova table;\n```{r}\nanova(lm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\ncoef(lm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising))\n```\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising) %>% confint()\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nvcov(lm(sales~TV + radio + newspaper,advertising))\n```\n\n# Selecting best regression varaibles\n\nYou are creating a new regression mdoel or improving an exiting model. You have many regression varaibles and you want to select the vest subset of those varaibles.\n\nThe `step` function can perform stepwise regression, either forward or backward. Backward stepwise regression starts with many varaibles and removes the underperformeners:\n\n```{r}\nlm <- lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising) # full model\nstats::step(lm, direction = \"backward\") %>% summary() # best model\n```\n\nbackward stepwise regression is the easiest approach.\n\nBackward stepwise is easy but sometimes its not feasible to start with everything because you have too many candidate variables. In that case use forward stepwise regression; which will start with nothing and incrementatlly add variables that improve regression. It stops when no further improvement is possible\n\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales ~ 1,advertising)\n```\n\nwe start with minimum model. We must tell step which candidate varaibels are available for inclusing in the model. We use `scope` argument for that.\n\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~1,advertising) %>% stats::step(direction = \"forward\", scope = (~ TV + radio + newspaper), trace = 0) %>% summary() \n```\nwe have the same result with backward, in reality these results may differ.\n```{r}\nstats::step(lm, direction = \"both\") %>% summary() \n```\n\n```{r}\nMASS::boxcox(lm)\n```\n\nDetecting the outliers

influence on the regression model, this is useful for diagnosing possible porblems with the data.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe `influence.measures` function reports several useful statistics for identifying inflıuentioal obs. and it flags the significant ones with an asterisk(*).\n\n```{r}\nlm <- lm(sales~TV + newspaper,advertising)\nlm %>% summary() %>% print() # r2 is 0.6422\n\ninf = influence.measures(lm)\n```\n\nWe need to filter for columns which has at least one true:\n```{r}\nas.data.frame(inf$is.inf) %>% as_tibble() %>% \n  mutate(obs = 1:200) %>% \n  filter(if_any(everything(), ~. == TRUE)) %>% print() %>% \n  pull(\"obs\") -> infss\ninfss\n```\n\n```{r}\nlm(sales~TV + newspaper,advertising[-infss,]) %>% summary() # r^2 improves!\nlm12 <-lm(sales~TV + newspaper,advertising[-infss,])\n```\n\n\n## testing residuals for autocorrelation\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(lmtest)\ndwtest(lm) \n```\n\nif $ p > 0.05$ no evidence of correaltion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"html_document","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":"a11y","toc":true,"output-file":"Chapter3.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
