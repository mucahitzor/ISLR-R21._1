    "text": "2.1 Simple Linear Regression\nPredicting a quantitative response \\(Y\\) on the basis of a single predictor variable \\(X\\).\nOur assumption is that there is approximately a linear relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\); we can write this linear relationship as\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\\[\nY \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\n\\] (3.1)\nFor example lets say \\(X\\) is TV, and \\(Y\\) is sales\n\\[\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV + \\epsilon\n\\] or\n\\[\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV\n\\]\nOn (3.1) \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are unknown constants that represent the intercept and slope in the linear model. Together they are known as coefficients or parameters.\nWe are going to use or training data to produce estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) =&gt; \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) =&gt; \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\). Using these predicted coefficients we can predict sales;\n\\[\n\\hat{sales} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\times TV\n\\]\nor as in general form\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x\n\\] (3.2)\n\n2.1.1 Estimating the coefficients\nSince, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are unknown, before we can use (3.1) to make predictions we must use data to estimate the coefficients. We have \\(n\\) observations :\n\\[\n(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \\dots, (x_n,y_n)\n\\]\nWe want our estimated coefficients to give such predictions that will fit the avaible data as well =&gt; \\(y_i \\approx \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i\\) for \\(i = 1,\\dots, n\\). This coefficients will allow us to draw a regression line and we want this regression line to be close as possible to the \\(n\\) data points we have.\nThere are different ways to measure closeness. The most common approach is minimizing the least squares criterion. Alternative approaches will be considered in Chapter 6.\nOur predictions come from \\(\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i\\).\nThen for each data we have a residual: difference between \\(y\\) and \\(\\hat{y}\\):\n\\[\ne_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i}\n\\]\nWe need to take the squares to get the distances–because of the negative residuals, and sum them to get the residual sum of squares(RSS)\n\\[\nRSS = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_n^2\n\\]\nthis is equal to\n\\[\nRSS = (y_i - \\hat{beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1)^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_2) + \\dots + (y_n - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_n)\n\\] (3.3)\nThe least squares approach chooses \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) to minimize RSS. These minimizers are\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\beta_1} &= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\\n\\hat{\\beta_0} &= \\bar{y_i} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x}\n\\end{align}\n\\] (3.4)\n\\(\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\\) and \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i\\) are the sample means.\nSo (3.4) defines the least squares coefficient estimates for simple linear regression.\nLets calculate them with R\n\nbeta_1_hat_adv = sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV)) * ((advertising$sales - mean(advertising$sales)))) / sum((advertising$TV - mean(advertising$TV))^2)\nbeta_1_hat_adv\n\n[1] 0.04753664\n\n\nSo; our $ = 0.0475 $\n\nbeta_0_hat_adv = mean(advertising$sales) - beta_1_hat_adv * mean(advertising$TV)\nbeta_0_hat_adv\n\n[1] 7.032594\n\n\nour \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} = 7.032\\)\nLets compare them with r function\n\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV, data = advertising))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sales ~ TV, data = advertising)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-8.3860 -1.9545 -0.1913  2.0671  7.2124 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The fit is found by minimizing the sum of squared errors. Each grey line segment represents an error, adn the fit make a comprimise by averaging their squares. In this case a linear fit captures the essence of the relationship, although it is somewhat deficient in the left of the plot\n\n\n\n\nSo we have\n\\[\n\\hat{y_i} = 7.032 + 0.0475x_i\n\\]\nAccording to this approximation an additional $1,000 spent on TV increases sales by 47.5 units.\n\n\n2.1.2 Assessing the Accuracy of the Coefficient Estimates\nWe assumed that true relationship is linear: \\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\). We don’t know \\(f\\), and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a mean-zero random error term.\nWe said \\(f\\) is approximatly linear, so that \\(f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\); which means\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\n\\] (3.5)\nerror term captures: * the true relationship may not be linear * other variables that affect Y * measurement error\nand is independent of \\(X\\).\n(3.5) is the population regression line: the best linar approximation to the true relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}X\n\\] is the least squares line.

Usually these characteristics are different, but generally sample characteristics will provide a good estimate to the population characteristics.\nComputing \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) from different sets of sample data provide different but similar results. And we are trying to estimate population parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) with these. Some of these \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) will overestimate, some will underestimate \\(\\beta_0\\), and \\(\\beta_1\\). But if we could average all these estimated parameters and take the average, than this average should be equal to population parameters; if this is the case this estimator is called unbiased estimator. So an unbiased estimator does not systematically over- or under-estimate the true parameter.\nOkay but how close \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) are to the true values \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). We want to compute the standard errors associated with \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\). Standard error telss us the average amount of estimate differes from the actual value.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_0})^2 &= \\sigma^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x}^2)}\\right] \\\\\n\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})^2 &= \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\end{align}\n\\] (3.8)\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2=\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)\\).\nNotice that formula of \\(\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\) is smaller when \\(x_i\\) are more spread out; intutively we have more leverage to estimate a slope when this is the case.\nIn general \\(\\sigma^2\\) is not known, but can be estimated from the data. The estimate of \\(\\sigma\\) is known as the residual standard error, and given by the formula\n\\[\n\\text{RSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{RSS}/(n-2)}\n\\] So, when \\(\\sigma^2\\) is estimated fro mthe data we should write \\(\\hat{\\text{SE}}(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\) to indicate that an estimate has been made, but usually we drop this extra hat.\nStandard errors can be used to compute confidence intervals. A 95% confidence interval is defines as a range of values such that with 95% probability, the rage will contain the true unknown value of the parameter. The range is defined in terms of lower and upper limits computed from the sample of data. For linear regression, the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) approximately takes the form\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta_1} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})\n\\] (3.9)\nSo there is approximately a 95% chance that the interval \\[[\\hat{\\beta_1} - 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1}), \\hat{\\beta_1} + 1.96 \\cdot \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta-1})]\\] (3.10) will contain the true value of \\(\\beta_1\\).

How far is enough? This depends on the accuracy of \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\)–that is it depends on \\(\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\).

From the t-statistic we can compute the p-value; a small p value indicates that it is unlikely to observe such a substantial association between the predictor and the response due to chance, in absence of any real association between the predictor and the response. So if p value is small we infer that there is assocaition between the predictor and the response =&gt; we reject the null hypothesis. Typical p-value cutoffs for rejecting the null hypothesis are 5 or 1%.

We can use either\n\nResidual standard error\n\\(R^2\\)\n\nResidual standard error\nRecall from \\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\epsilon_i\\) that associated with each observation is an error term \\(\\epsilon\\). Because of these error terms even if we knew the true regression line, we would not be able to predict \\(Y\\) from \\(X\\). The RSE is an estimate of the standard deviation of \\(\\epsilon\\). It is the average amount that the response will deviate from the true regression line, computed by\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{RSE} &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\text{RSS}} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}\n\\end{align}\n\\] (3.15)\nIn the advertising data, RSE was 3.26; actual sales in each market deviate from the true regression line by approximately 3,269 units, on average. This also means that; if the model were correct and the true values of the unknown coefficients \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) were known exaclty, any predcition of sales on the basis of TV advertising would still be off by about 3,260 units on average. Is this prediction error accaptable? Depends on the data: in the advertising data set the mean value of sales is \\(\\approx 14,000\\) units, and so the percentage error is \\(3,260 / 14,000 = 23%\\).\nThe RSE is considered a measure of the lack of fit of the model \\(Y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon\\) to the data. If the predictions from the model are very close to the true outcome values–\\(\\hat{y_i} \\approx y_i\\) then RSE will be small, and we can concldue that the model fits the data very well. Otherwise, if \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) is very far from \\(y_i\\) then RSE may be quite large, indicating the model doesn’t fit the data well.\n\\(R^2\\)Statistic\nThe RSE provides an absolute measure of lack of fit of the model to the data. \\(R^2\\) provides an alternative measure of fit. It takes the form of a proportion–the proportion of variance explained–and so its always \\(0\\leq R^2 \\leq 1\\) and is independent of the scale of \\(Y\\)–as opposed to RSE.\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{TSS - RSS}{TSS} = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS}\n\\] (3.17)\nwhere \\(\\text{TSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\) is the total sun of squares and \\(\\text{RSS} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2\\). TSS measures the total variaance in the response \\(Y\\); and can be thought of as the amount of varaiblity ingerent in the response before the regression is performed. RSS measures the amount of varaiblity that is left unexplained after performing the regression. So TSS - RSS measures the amount of variability in the response that is explained by performing the regression, and \\(R^2\\) measures the proportion of variability in \\(Y\\) that can be explained using \\(X\\). As \\(R^2\\) gets closer to 1, a large proportion of the variability in the response has been explained by the regression. A number near 0 indicates that the regression did not explain much of the variablity in the response; this might occur because the linear model is wrong, or the inherit error \\(\\sigma^2 = \\text{RSE}^2\\) is high, or both.\nLets calculate \\(R^2\\) of our estimation on advertising data with the model \\(\\hat{sales_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}TV_i\\)\n\nadvertising %&gt;% \n  mutate(sales_hat = beta_0_hat_adv + beta_1_hat_adv * TV) -&gt; advertising\nadvertising\n\n# A tibble: 200 × 5\n      TV radio newspaper sales sales_hat\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 230.   37.8      69.2  22.1     18.0 \n 2  44.5  39.3      45.1  10.4      9.15\n 3  17.2  45.9      69.3   9.3      7.85\n 4 152.   41.3      58.5  18.5     14.2 \n 5 181.   10.8      58.4  12.9     15.6 \n 6   8.7  48.9      75     7.2      7.45\n 7  57.5  32.8      23.5  11.8      9.77\n 8 120.   19.6      11.6  13.2     12.7 \n 9   8.6   2.1       1     4.8      7.44\n10 200.    2.6      21.2  10.6     16.5 \n# ℹ 190 more rows\n\n\n\nRSS = sum((advertising$sales - advertising$sales_hat)^2)\nRSS\n\n[1] 2102.531\n\n\n\nRSE = sqrt(RSS/(length(advertising$sales) -2))\nRSE\n\n[1] 3.258656\n\n\n\nTSS = sum((advertising$sales - mean(advertising$sales))^2)\nTSS\n\n[1] 5417.149\n\n\n\nR2 = (TSS - RSS) / TSS\nR2\n\n[1] 0.6118751\n\n\n61% of the variablity in sales is explained by a linear regression on TV.\nwhat about our data\n\ndata\n\n# A tibble: 100 × 3\n        y      x  y_hat\n    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 -0.591 -0.667 -0.159\n 2  2.69   0.222  2.56 \n 3 -2.61  -1.03  -1.27 \n 4 -3.54  -1.39  -2.38 \n 5  1.54  -0.545  0.212\n 6  2.22   0.384  3.05 \n 7 -1.34  -1.56  -2.88 \n 8  6.81   1.39   6.14 \n 9  6.26   1.43   6.27 \n10  2.39   0.465  3.30 \n# ℹ 90 more rows\n\n\n\nRSS_data = sum((data$y - data$y_hat)^2)\nRSS_data\n\n[1] 82.28514\n\n\n\nRSE_data = sqrt(RSS_data/(length(data$y) -2))\nRSE_data\n\n[1] 0.9163211\n\n\n\nTSS_data = sum((data$y - mean(data$y))^2)\nTSS_data\n\n[1] 1439.473\n\n\n\nR2_data = (TSS_data - RSS_data) / TSS_data\nR2_data\n\n[1] 0.9428366\n\n\n94% of the variablity in y is explained by x; very good fit of the model.\n\\(R^2\\) is better to interpret than RSE."

First of all it is unclear to make a sinlge prediction of sales given levesl of the three advertising media budgets, since each has their own regression equation. Second, each of these three regression equations ignores the other two medi in forming estimates for the regression coefficients. Especially if these media budgets are correalted, this can lead to very misleading estimates of the individaul media effects on sales.\nInstead of the seperate linear regressions for each predictor, better approach is to extend the simple linear regression setting \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\) to\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon\n\\]\n(3.19)\nHere we interpret \\(B_j\\) as the average effect of a one unit increase in \\(X_j\\), holding all other predictors fixed.\nFor the advertising example;\n\\[\nsales = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TV + \\beta_2 radio + \\beta_3 newspaper + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\n2.2.1 Estimating the Regression Coefficients\nAgain, regression coefficients in (3.19) are unknown, and must be estimated from the data.

We choose \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) to minimize the sum of squared residuals\n$$ \\[\\begin{align}\n\n\\text{RSS} &= \\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2 \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - \\hat{\\beta_0} - \\hat{\\beta_1}x_{i1} - \\beta_2x_{i2} - \\dots - \\beta_px_{ip})^2\n\n\\end{align}\\] $$ (3.22)\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1},\\dots, \\hat{\\beta_p}\\) values minimize RSS.\nWe are not going to calculate these estimates with our hands, R does that.\nLets see our model results with the three predictors.\n\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, data = advertising)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-8.8277 -0.8908  0.2418  1.1893  2.8292 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

In contrsat, in the multiple regression setting, the coefficient for newspaper represents the average effect of increeasing newapper spending by one dollar, while holding tv and radio fixed.\nDoes it make sense for the multiple regression to suggest no relationship between sales and newspaper while the simple linear regression implies the opposite? Yes!\nTake a look at this correlation matrix:\n\ncor(advertising[1:4])\n\n                  TV      radio  newspaper     sales\nTV        1.00000000 0.05480866 0.05664787 0.7822244\nradio     0.05480866 1.00000000 0.35410375 0.5762226\nnewspaper 0.05664787 0.35410375 1.00000000 0.2282990\nsales     0.78222442 0.57622257 0.22829903 1.0000000\n\n\nWe can also make it a plot out of this:\n\ncorrplot(cor(advertising[1:4]), method = \"number\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that correlation between radio and newspaper is 0.35. This reveals a tendency to spend more on newspaper advertising in markets where more is spent on radio advertising. Now suppose the multiple regression is correct and newspaper advertising has no direct impact on sales, but radio advertising does increase sales. Then in markets where we spend more on radio, our sales will tend to be higher, adn as our correaltion matrix shows, we also tend to spend more on newspaper advertising in those same markets. Hence, in a simple linaer regresion which only examines sales vs newspaper, we will observe that higher values of newspaper tend to be associated with higher values of sales, even though newspaper advertising does not actually affect sales. So newspaper sales are proxy for radio advertising; newspaper gets credit for the effect of radio on sales.\nThis is a very common issue. Consider running a regression of shark attack versus ice cream sales for data collected at a given beach community. We would see a positive relationship, similar to that seen between sales and newspaper. Of course ice creams doesnt cause shark attacks. In reality higher temperatures cause more people to visit the beach in trun results in more ice cream sales and more shark attacks. A multiple regression of attacks versus ice cream sales and temperature revals that, the former predictr is no longer significant after adjusting for temperature.\n\n\n2.2.2 Some important Questions\nWhen we perform MLR, we usually are interested answering a few important questions\n\nIs at least one of the predictors \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\) useful in predicting the response?\nDo all predictors help to explain \\(Y\\), or is only a subset of the predictors useful?\nHow well does the model fit the data?\n\n4 Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict, and how accurate is our prediction?\nLets answer these questions:\n\nIs at least one of the predictors \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\) useful in predicting the response?\nIn SLR we simply checked whether \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) or not. In MLR, we need to ask whether all of the regression coefficients are zero \\(\\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\dots = \\beta_p = 0\\). So our null hypothesis is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_0 &: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\dots = \\beta_o = 0 \\\\\nH_\\alpha &: \\text{at least one} \\space B_j \\space \\text{is non-zero}\n\\end{align}\n\\] This hypothesis test is performed by computing the F-statistic,\n\\[\nF = \\frac{(TSS - RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\n\\] (3.23)\nSo, if there is no relationship between the resposne and predictors, we expect F-statistic to take on value close to 1. if \\(H_\\alpha\\) is true then \\(F\\) should be greater than 1.\n\n\nsummary(lm(sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, advertising))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sales ~ TV + radio + newspaper, data = advertising)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-8.8277 -0.8908  0.2418  1.1893  2.8292 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

But it is best to have a look at the p-value of the F statistic which is also very small.\nThis means that at least one of the media is associated with increase sales.\nIn (3.23) we are testing \\(H_0\\) that all the coefficients are zero. Sometimes we want to test that a particular subset of \\(q\\) of the coefficients are zero. This corresponesd to a null hypothesis\n\\[\n  H_0 : \\beta_{p-q+1} = \\beta_{p-q+2} = \\dots = \\beta_p\n  \\]\nIn this case we fit a second model that uses all the variables except those last \\(q\\). suppose that residual sum of squares for that model is \\(RSS_0\\). Then the appropriate F-statistic is\n\\[\n  F = \\frac{(RSS_0 - RSS)/q}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\n  \\] (3.24)\nOn advertising MLR we saw that newspaper is not significant from its p value. Then why do we need to look at the overall F-statistic? after all, it seems likely that if any one of the p-values for the individual variables is very small, then at least one of the predictors is realted to the respose. This is not true usually, especially when \\(p\\) is large.\nSo after estimating the model first look at the F-statistic, than to the individual t statistic p values.\n\nDo all predictors help to explain \\(Y\\), or is only a subset of the predictors useful? =&gt; Deciding on important variables\nAfter lookig at the F statistic, we can look at the individual p values. But if *p$ is large, we are going to make false discoveries.\nUsually not all predictors are associated with the response. This task of determining which predictors are associated with the response in order to fit a single model involving only those predictors is refered to as variable selection. Check out Chapter 6 for more detail. But here is a breif outline of some of the classical approaches.\nIdeally we want to perform variable selection by trying out a lot of different models, each containing different subset of the predictors. For instance if our \\(p=2\\) then we can consider four models\n\n\na model containing no variables\n\n\na model containing \\(x_1\\) only\n\n\na model containnig \\(x_2\\) only\n\n\na model containing \\(x1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\n\n\nWe can then select the best model out of all the models by looking at some statistics we can use to judge the quality of the model. These are\n\nMallow’s \\(C_p\\)\nAkaike information creterion (AIC)\nBayesian information criterion(BIC)\nadjusted \\(R^2\\)\n\nThese are discussed in more detail in chapter 6.\nWe can also determine which model is the best by plotting various model outputs, such as the residuals, in order to search for patterns.\nBut we cannot consider all models, especially when \\(p\\) is high. There are three classical approaches for this task:\n\nForward selection\n\nbegin with null model a model that contains an intercept but no predictors.\nThen fit p simple linear regressions and add to the null model the variable that results in the lowest RSS.\nThen add to that model the variable that results in the lowest RSS for the new two-variable model. This approach is continued until some stopping rule is satisfied.\n\nBackward selection\n\nPut all varaibles in the model.\nremove the least statistically significant predictor.\nestimate the new regression with \\(p-1\\) variable, remove the largest p-value predictor. This procedure continues until a stopping rule is reached =&gt; stop after all remaining variables have p value &lt; 0.02\n\nMixed selection\n\nCombination of forward selection and backward selection\nStart with no variables in the model\nadd the varaible that provides the best fit\nadd varaibles one-by-one\nat one point if the p-value for one of the variables in the model rises above a certain treshold, then we remove that variabel from the model.\nContinue untill all variables have sufficiently low p value, and all vairables in the model woudl have a large p-value if added to the model\n\n\nBackwar slecetion cannot be used if \\(p&gt;n\\), forward selection can always be used.\nHow well does the model fit the data? Model Fit\n\nTwo of the most common numerical measures of model fit are RSE and \\(R^2\\).\nIn SLR \\(R^2\\) is equal to \\(cor(Y,X)\\). In MLR \\(R^2 = cor(Y,\\hat{Y})\\).\n\\(R^2\\) will always increase as you add more variable, even though that varaible is not statistically significant. This is because adding another variable must allow us to fit the trainig data(not necessarly test data) more accurately. But this increase in \\(R^2\\) after adding a statistically not-significant varible is very low =&gt; evidence that you can drop the not significant variable.

Adding newspaper increases RSE because\n\\[\nRSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-p-1}RSS}\n\\]\nModels with more variables can have higher RSE if the decrease in RSS is small relative to the increase in \\(p\\).\nSo we can look at both the RSE and \\(R^2\\).\nFour: Predictions\nAfter fitting the model we can predict \\(Y\\) =&gt; \\(\\hat{y}\\) with estimated coefficients. However, there are three sorts of uncertainty associated with this prediction:\n\nThe coefficient esstimates \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1},\\dots,\\hat{\\beta_p}\\) are estimates for \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\):\nThat is, the least squares plane\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\dots +  \\hat{\\beta_p}x_p\n\\]\nwhich is only an estimate for the true population regression plane \\[\nf(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\n\\]\nSo there is an inaccuracy in the coefficient estimates =&gt; this is the reducible error from Chapter 2. We can compute a confidence interval to determine how close \\(\\hat{y}\\) will be to \\(f(X)\\).\n\nAssuming a linear model for \\(f(X)\\) is almost always an aaproximation of reality (usually relationships are not linear), so ther is an additional source of potentially reducible error =&gt; this is the model bias.\nWhen we are using a linear model, we are in fact estimating the best linear approximation to the true surface. However, we will ignore this discrepancy and operate as if the linear model is correct\nEven if we knew \\(f(X)\\)–that is even if we knew the true values of \\(\\beta\\)–the response value cannot be predicted perfectly because of the random error \\(\\epsilon\\) in the model =&gt; irreducable error. How much will \\(Y\\) vary from \\(\\hat{y}\\) =&gt; we use prediction intervals to answer this question.\nPredicion intervals are always wider than confidence intervals, because they contain both the reducible error(error from estimating coefficients of \\(f(X)\\)) and irreducible error.\n\nWe use a confidence interval to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the average sales over a large number of cities. For example given that $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 is spent on radio advertising in each city, the 95% confidence interval is \\([10,985, 11,528]\\). We interpret this to mean that 95% of intervals of this form will contain the true value of \\(f(X)\\).\nOn the other hand, a prediction interval can be used to quantify the uncertainty surrounding sales for a particular city. Given that $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 is spent on radio advertising in that city the 95% prediction interval is \\([7,930, 14,580]\\). We interpret this to mean that 95% of intervals of this form will contain the true value of \\(Y\\) for this city. Note that both intervals are centered at 11,256, but that the prediction intervaş is substantially wider than the confidence interval, reflecting the increased uncertainty about sales for a given city in comparison to the average sales over many locations."

If a qualitative predictors (also known as factor) only has two levels, then incorporating it into a regression model is very simple. We create a dummy variable that takes on two possible numerical values. For example based on Gender varaible, we can create a new varaible that takes the form\n\\[\nx_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is female} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if}\\space i\\text{th} \\space\\text{person is male}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] (3.26)\nand use this variable as a predictor in the regression equation.

The level with no dummy variable–African American in this example–is known as the baseline.\nFrom the regression results we see that the estimated balance for the baseline, African American, is $531.00. It is estimated that Asian category will have $18.69 less debt than the African American category on average, and the Caucasian category will have $12.50 less debt that the African American category. However, p-values associated with the coefficient estimates for the two dummy variables are very large, suggesting no statistical evidence of a real difference in credit card balance between the ethnicities. The coefficients will change bassed on the baseline and coding.\nRather than relying on the individual coefficients, we can use F-test to test \\(H_0 : \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = 0\\); this does not depend on the coding. The F-test has a p-value of 0.9575, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between balance and ethnicity.\nUsing this dummy variable approach presents no difficulties when using both quantitative and qualitative predictors. For example, to regress balance on both a quantitative varaible such as income and a qualitative variable such as student, we must simply create a dummy varaible for student and then fit a multiple linear regression model using income and the dummy variable as the predictors for credit card balance.\n\n\n2.3.2 Extensions of the Linear Model\nLinear regression model is very interpretable and works quite well on many real-world problems. However, it makes several highly restrictive assumptions that are ofthen violated in practice. Two of them ost important assumptions state that the relationship between the predictors and response are additive and linear.\nThe additive assumption means that the effect of changes in a predictor \\(x_j\\) on the response \\(Y\\) is independent of the vlaues of the other predictors.\nThe linear assumption means thatt the change in the response \\(Y\\) due to one-unit change in \\(x_j\\) is constant, regardless of the vlaue of \\(x_j\\).\nWe can relax these assumptions. Here some classical approaches to do that\nRemoving the Additive Assumption\nFrom Advertising data, we concluded that both TV and radio seem to be associated with sales. Our model was linear; the effect of TV and radio advertising spending on sales is independent of each other, and their effect is constant no matter the level of spending.\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TV_i + \\beta_2 radio_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\] this model means that, the average effect on sales of a one unit increase in tv is always \\(\\beta_1\\) regardless of the amount spent on radio.\nHowever, this simple model may be incorrect. Suppose that spending money on radio advertising actually increases the effectiveness of TV advertising, so that the slope term for TV should increase as radio increases. In this situation, given a fixed budget $100,000, spending half on radio and half on TV may increase sales more than allocating the entire amount to either TV or to radio. In marketing this is known as the synergy effect, in statistics interaction effect.\nConsider the standard linear regression with two variables,\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\epsilon\n\\] Here if we increaes \\(x_1\\) by one unit, \\(Y\\) will increase by an average of \\(\\beta_1\\) units. The presence of \\(x_2\\) does not alter this statement-regardless of the value of \\(x_2\\), a one-unit increase in \\(x_1\\) will lead to \\(\\beta_1\\) unit increae in \\(Y\\).\nWe can extend this model by allowing interaction effects by including a third predictor, called an interaction term, which is constructed by computing the product of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\):\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \\epsilon\n\\] (3.31)\nWe can write this equation\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nY &= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 x_2)x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 +\\epsilon \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + \\tilde{\\beta_1}x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(\\tilde{\\beta_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3x_2\\). Since \\(\\tilde{\\beta_1}\\) changes with \\(x_2\\), the effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(Y\\) is no longer constant: adjusting \\(x_2\\) will change the impact of \\(x_1\\) on \\(Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductivy of a factory\n\n\n\nSuppose that we are interested in studying the productivity of a factory. We want to predict the number of units produced on the basis of the number of production lines and the total number of workers. Probably the effect of increasing lines on units produced will depend on the number of workers, since if no workers are available to operate the lines, then increasing the number of lines will not increase the production. This suggest to include an interaction term between lines and workers in a linear model to predict units.\nSuppose when we fit the model, we obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nunits &\\approx 1.2 + 3.4 \\times lines + 0.22 \\times workers + 1.4 \\times (lines \\times workers) \\\\\n&= 1.2 + (3.4 + 1.4 \\times workers) \\times lines + 0.22 \\times workers\n\\end{align}\n\\] Adding an addtional line will increase the number of units produced by \\(3.4 + 1.4 \\times workers\\). Hence, the more workers we have, the stronger will be the effect of lines.\n\n\nFor the advitising, a linear model that uses radio, TV and interaction between the two to predict sales takes the form\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nsales &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times TV + \\beta_2 \\times radio + \\beta_3 \\times(radio \\times TV) + \\epsilon \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3 \\times radio)\\times Tv + \\beta_2 \\times radio + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\] (3.33) We can interpret \\(\\beta_3\\) as the increase in the effectiveness of TV advertising for a one unit increse in radio advertising (or vice versa).

This means that the relationship is not additive.\nTo interpret the coefficients:\n$1,000 increse in TV advertising results with \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} +\\hat{\\beta_3}\\times radio = \\$19.1 + \\$1.09 \\times radio\\) increase in sales on average.\n$1,000 invrease in radio advertising results with \\(\\hat{\\beta_2} + \\hat{\\beta_3} \\times TV = \\$28.9 + \\$1.09 \\times TV\\) increase in sales on average.\nAll p-values are significant =&gt; all three varibles should be included in the model.\nSometimes interaction term has a very small pvalue but the associated main effects(in this case TV and radio) do not. The hieararchial principle states that if we include an interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects, even if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not significant.\nHere both our varaibles were quantitative. However, the consept of interaction applies to qualitative varaibles, or combination of qualitative and quantitative varibles. Actually interaction between a quantitative and qualitative variable has a particularly nice interpreateion:\nConsider the Credit data set. Suppose we want to predict balance using income(quantitative) and student(qualitative) varaibles. In the absence of an interaction term the model takes the form\n\\[\nbalance_i  \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times income_i +\n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_2 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is not student}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\nbalance_i = \\beta_1 \\times income +\n\\begin{cases}\n\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 & \\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student} \\\\\n\\beta_0 &\\text{if} \\space i\\text{th} \\space \\text{person is student}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] (3.34)\nNotice that this amounts to fitting two parallel lines to the data, one for students and one for non-students. The lines for students and non students have different intercepts, \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_2\\) versus \\(\\beta_0\\), but the slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is the same.\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(Balance ~ Income + Student, Credit) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  summary()\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = Balance ~ Income + Student, data = data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-762.37 -331.38  -45.04  323.60  818.28 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This is a limitation; change in income may have a very different effect on the credit card balance of a student versus non student.\nThis limitation can be addressed by adding an interaction varaible, created by multiplying student and income with the dummy for student.

Check out Chapter 7.\n\n\n2.3.3 Potential Problems\nWhen we fit a linear regression model to a particular data set, many problems may occur. Most common among these are the following\n\nNon-linearity of the response-predictor relationships.\nCorrealation of error terms\nNon-constant variance of error terms\nOutliers\nHigh-leverage points\nCollinearity\n\nLets breifly discuss each\n1.Non-linearity of the Data\nLinear regression assumes there is a straight line relationship between the predictors and the respose. If the true relationship is far from linear, then our estimations are not good. Also our prediction accuracy is reduced.\nResidual plots are a useful graphical tool for identifying non-linearity.\nWe can plot the residuals \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i}\\) versus \\(x_i\\) for Simple linear regression.\nFor multiple linear regression since we have lost of \\(x_i\\) we plot residuals versus predicted values(\\(e_i\\) vs \\(\\hat{y_i}\\)).\nWe want to have no visible pattern. If there is a pattern =&gt; problem!\nSo what do we expect a plot of “fitted” vs “resid”; if the relationship is linear as the “fitted” values increase “resid” should not increase or decrease, should swing with no relationship: linear.\nIf the relationship is not linear then we expect ot see a pattern because as the fitted values increase the resiudls will increase.\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  augment() \n\n# A tibble: 392 × 9\n   .rownames   mpg horsepower .fitted .resid    .hat .sigma   .cooksd .std.resid\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1            18        130   19.4  -1.42  0.00368   4.91   1.54e-4    -0.289 \n 2 2            15        165   13.9   1.11  0.00888   4.91   2.31e-4     0.227 \n 3 3            18        150   16.3   1.74  0.00613   4.91   3.91e-4     0.356 \n 4 4            16        150   16.3  -0.259 0.00613   4.91   8.66e-6    -0.0530\n 5 5            17        140   17.8  -0.838 0.00473   4.91   6.96e-5    -0.171 \n 6 6            15        198    8.68  6.32  0.0177    4.90   1.52e-2     1.30  \n 7 7            14        220    5.21  8.79  0.0256    4.89   4.33e-2     1.82  \n 8 8            14        215    6.00  8.00  0.0236    4.89   3.30e-2     1.65  \n 9 9            14        225    4.42  9.58  0.0276    4.89   5.57e-2     1.98  \n10 10           15        190    9.95  5.05  0.0152    4.91   8.31e-3     1.04  \n# ℹ 382 more rows\n\n\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=horsepower, y = .resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + theme_light()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we observe a U-shape trend; indicating non-linear relationship between horsepower and mpg.\nLets do a plot of fitted vs residual for linear and non linear regression:\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower, Auto) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") + theme_light()\n,\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), Auto) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") + theme_light(), ncol=2)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the plots. On the left fitted vs resid for regressing horsepower onto mpg, on the right regressing horsepower and horsepower^2 onto mpg.\nBlue line is a smooth fit to the residuals to identify trends easily. The residuals on the left panel exhibit a clear U shape, which is a strong indication that the true relationship is not linear.\nRight hand panel displays a little pattern, suggesting that the quadratic term improves the fit to the data.\nIf the residual plot indicates that there are non-linear associations in the data, then a simple approach is to use non-linear transformations of the predictors, such as \\(\\log X\\), \\(\\sqrt{X}\\), and \\(X^2\\), in the regression model. We will discuss more later on.\n2.Correlation of Error Terms\nAn important assumption of the linear regression is that error terms \\(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\dots, \\epsilon_n\\) are uncorrelated. This means that \\(\\epsilon_{i+1} \\neq f(\\epsilon_i)\\). The standard errors that are computed for the estimated regression coeffieints or the fitted values are based on this assumption. If there is correaltion among the error terms, the estimated standard errors will tend to underestimate the true standard errors =&gt; confidence and prediction intervals will be narrower than they should be. P-values will be lower as well, causing false discoveries perhaps.\nUsually correlation among error terms occur in time series data. In many cases, observations that are obtained at adjacent time points will have positevely correalated errors. To test this we can plot the residuals from our model as a function of time. If the errors are uncorrelated, then we expect no pattern. If the error terms are positevly correlated, then we may see tracking in the residuals–adjacent residuals may have similar values.\n Check out Figure 3.10. In the top panel, we see the residuals from a linear regression fit to data generated with uncorrelated errors. Adjacent years don’t take similar values; there is no evidence of a time-related trend in the residuals. But in the bottom panel, we see plotted residuals which have correlation 0.9 with time: now there is a clear pattern in the residuals–adjacent residuals tend to take on similar values. Finally, the center panel illustrates a more moderate case in which residuals had a correlation of 0.5. There is still evidence of tracking, but the pattern is less clear.\nCorrelation among the error terms can also occur outside of time series data. For instance, consider a study where we predict people’s hights from their weights. The assumption of uncorrelated errors could be violated if some of the individauls in the study are members of the same family, or eat the same diet, or have been exposed to same environmental factors.\n3.Non-constant Variance of Error Terms\nAnother important assumption of the linear regression model is that error terms have a constant variance, \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma^2\\). The standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests rely upon this assumption.\nUnfortunately, often variances of the error terms are non-constant =&gt; heteroscedasticity. For instance, variances of the error terms may increase with the value of the response. We can identify non-constant variances in the errors from the presence of a funnel shape in the residual plot.\n On the left panel magnitude of the residuals tends to increase with the fitted values. When faced with this problem, one possible solution is to transform the response \\(Y\\) using a concave function such as \\(\\log Y\\) or \\(\\sqrt{Y}\\). Such a transformation results in a greater amount of shrinkage of the larger responses, leading to a reduction in heteroscedasticity. On the right hand panel we see that residuals apper to have constant variance.\n4.Outliers\nAn outlier is a point for which \\(y_i\\) is far from the vlaue predicted by the model.\n\nThe red point (observation 20) in the left-hand panel of Figure 3.12 illustrates a typical outlier. The red solid line is the least squares regression fit, while the blue dashed line is the least squares fit after removel of the outlier. In this case, removing the outlier has little effect on the least squares line: it leads to almost no change in the slope, and a minuscule reduction in the intercept. This is normal. However, it can cause other problems: RSE is 1.09 when outlier is included, but it is only 0.77 when excluded =&gt; RSE is used to calculate all confidence intervals, p values =&gt; bias. \\(R^2\\) also decreases from 0.829 to 0.805 when included outlier.\nResidual plots can be used to identify outliers =&gt; center panel of Figure 3.12. But it can be difficult to decide how large a residual needs to before we consider the point to be an outlier. To address this problem instead of plotting the residuals we can plot the studentized residuals computed by dividing each residuls \\(e_i\\) by its estimated standard error.\n\\[\ne_i^*=\\frac{e_i}{sd(e_i)} = \\frac{e_i}{\\sqrt{MSE(1-h_{ii})}}\n\\] \\(h_{ii}\\) is leverage point.\nObservations whose studentized residuals are greater than 3 in absolute value are possible outliers. In the right-hand panel of Figure 3.12 the outlier’s studentized residual exceeds 6; while all other observations have studentized residauls between -2 and 2.\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(sales~TV + radio,advertising) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  augment() %&gt;% \n  mutate(.std.resid_3 = ifelse(abs(.std.resid) &gt;=3,T,F), id = 1:200) %&gt;% \n  print %&gt;% \n  ggplot() + aes(x=.fitted, y =.std.resid, color = .std.resid_3) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\",\"red\")) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(.std.resid_3 == T,id,\"\")), nudge_x = 0.5, show.legend = F)+ theme_light() \n\n# A tibble: 200 × 11\n   sales    TV radio .fitted  .resid    .hat .sigma   .cooksd .std.resid\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  22.1 230.   37.8   20.6   1.54   0.0140    1.68 0.00406       0.925 \n 2  10.4  44.5  39.3   12.3  -1.95   0.0188    1.68 0.00871      -1.17  \n 3   9.3  17.2  45.9   12.3  -3.04   0.0295    1.67 0.0341       -1.83  \n 4  18.5 152.   41.3   17.6   0.883  0.0124    1.68 0.00117       0.528 \n 5  12.9 181.   10.8   13.2  -0.324  0.00951   1.69 0.000120     -0.194 \n 6   7.2   8.7  48.9   12.5  -5.31   0.0347    1.64 0.124        -3.22  \n 7  11.8  57.5  32.8   11.7   0.0818 0.0129    1.69 0.0000105     0.0490\n 8  13.2 120.   19.6   12.1   1.09   0.00576   1.68 0.000823      0.653 \n 9   4.8   8.6   2.1    3.71  1.09   0.0271    1.68 0.00401       0.658 \n10  10.6 200.    2.6   12.6  -1.95   0.0171    1.68 0.00797      -1.17  \n# ℹ 190 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: .std.resid_3 &lt;lgl&gt;, id &lt;int&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\nplot(lm(sales ~ TV + radio,advertising), which = 3)\n\n\n\n\nWe have spotted that 6th and 131 are possible outliers.\nHere is all the data regression result:\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  summary()\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = sales ~ TV + radio, data = data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-8.7977 -0.8752  0.2422  1.1708  2.8328 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

In contrast, observations with high leverage have an unusual value for \\(x_i\\).\n\nFor example observation 41 in the left-hand panel of Figure 3.13 has high leverage =&gt; predictor value for this observation is large relative to other observations. The red solid line is the least squares fit to the data, the blue dashed line is the fit when obs 41 is removed.\nRemoving the high leverage observation has a much more substantial impact on the least squares line than removing an outlier. High leverage obss have a big impact on the estiamted regression line. It is important to identify them.\nFor SLR =&gt; look at the range of \\(x_i\\) and spot the out of range observations.\nMLR =&gt; it is possible to have an observation that is well within the range of each individual predictor’s values, but that is unusual in terms of the full set of predictors.\nHave a look at the center panel in Figure 3.13. Most of the observations’ predictor values fall within the blue dashed ellipse, but the red observation is well outside of this range. But neither its value for \\(x_1\\) nor \\(x_2\\) is unusual.\nWe can quantify an observation’s leverage using the leverage statistic. A large value indicates a high leverage.\nFor SLR:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nh_i &= \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{i'=1}^n(x_{i'} - \\bar{x})^2} \\\\\n&1/n \\leq h_i \\leq 1 \\\\\n&\\bar{h_i} = (p+1)/n\n\\end{align}\n\\] as \\(x_i\\) increases its distance from \\(\\bar{x}\\) \\(h_i\\) increases.\n\\(h_i\\) is always between \\(1/n\\) and \\(1\\), and the average leverage for all the observations is always equal to \\((p+1)/n\\). If an observation has a \\(h\\) that greatly exceeds \\((p+1)/n\\) then we may suspect of high leverage.\nRight hand panel of Figure 3.13 shows studentized residuals versus \\(h_i\\). Obs 41 stands out as having a very high leverage statistic as well as a high studentized residual =&gt; It is an outlier as well as a high leverage observaiton. This is very dangerous. This plot also shows the reason that obs 20 had relatively little effect on the least sqaures fit in Figure 3.12: it has low leverage.\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(sales ~ TV + radio, advertising) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  augment()\n\n# A tibble: 200 × 9\n   sales    TV radio .fitted  .resid    .hat .sigma   .cooksd .std.resid\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  22.1 230.   37.8   20.6   1.54   0.0140    1.68 0.00406       0.925 \n 2  10.4  44.5  39.3   12.3  -1.95   0.0188    1.68 0.00871      -1.17  \n 3   9.3  17.2  45.9   12.3  -3.04   0.0295    1.67 0.0341       -1.83  \n 4  18.5 152.   41.3   17.6   0.883  0.0124    1.68 0.00117       0.528 \n 5  12.9 181.   10.8   13.2  -0.324  0.00951   1.69 0.000120     -0.194 \n 6   7.2   8.7  48.9   12.5  -5.31   0.0347    1.64 0.124        -3.22  \n 7  11.8  57.5  32.8   11.7   0.0818 0.0129    1.69 0.0000105     0.0490\n 8  13.2 120.   19.6   12.1   1.09   0.00576   1.68 0.000823      0.653 \n 9   4.8   8.6   2.1    3.71  1.09   0.0271    1.68 0.00401       0.658 \n10  10.6 200.    2.6   12.6  -1.95   0.0171    1.68 0.00797      -1.17  \n# ℹ 190 more rows\n\n\nleverages are shown in .hat here.\n\nplot(lm(sales~TV,advertising), which = 5)\n\n\n\n\n6.Collinearity\nCollinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables are closely related to one another.\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\n  Credit %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x=Limit, y = Age) + geom_point(color =\"red\", alpha =0.4),\n  Credit %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x=Limit, y= Rating) + geom_point(color =\"red\", alpha = 0.4),\n  ncol=2\n)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14\n\n\n\n\nIn the left panel of Figure 3.14 we see no relationship, but on the right hand panel predicors are highly correlated: they are collinear =&gt; it is difficult to seperate out the individual effects of colliniar varaibles on the response.\nCollinearity reduces the accuracy of the estiamtes of the regression coefficients, it causes the standard error for \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) to grow. t-statistic for each predictor is calculated by dividing \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) by its standard error =&gt; collinearity declines the t-statistics =&gt; we may fail to reject \\(H_0:\\beta_j = 0\\).\nLets do two regressions:\n\nmodel1: balance regressed onto age and limit which has no collinearity\nmodel2: balance regressed onto rating and limit which are collinear.\n\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(Balance ~ Age + Limit, Credit) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  tidy() %&gt;% mutate(model = 1) %&gt;% \n  bind_rows(\n    linear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(Balance ~ Rating + Limit, Credit) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  tidy() %&gt;% mutate(model =2)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  term         estimate std.error statistic   p.value model\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept) -173.      43.8        -3.96  9.01e-  5     1\n2 Age           -2.29     0.672      -3.41  7.23e-  4     1\n3 Limit          0.173    0.00503    34.5   1.63e-121     1\n4 (Intercept) -378.      45.3        -8.34  1.21e- 15     2\n5 Rating         2.20     0.952       2.31  2.13e-  2     2\n6 Limit          0.0245   0.0638      0.384 7.01e-  1     2\n\n\nIn the first model both age and limit are statistically significant. In the second, collinearity between limit and raiting has caused standard error for the limit coefficient estimate to increase by a factor of 12 and p-value to increase to 0.701. The importance of the limit variable has been masked due to presence of collinearity.\nA simple way to detect collinearity is to look at the correlation matrix of the predictors. Correlation matrix shows the relatinship of two variables but, it is possible for colşinearty to exist between three or more varaibles even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation. This situation is called multicollinaerity.\nInstead of inspecting the correlatino matrix, better way to assess multicollinaerity is to compute the variance inflation factor (VIF). The VIF is the raio of the variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) when fitting the model divided by the variance of \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) if fit on its own.\n\\[\n1 \\leq VIF\n\\] Smallest possible value of VIF is 1: complete absence of collinearity. Usuall there is always some degree of collinearity among the predictors. A VIF that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinaerity.\nThe VIF for each vairable can be computed using the formula\n\\[\nVIF(\\hat{\\beta_j}) = \\frac{1}{1-R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}}\n\\] \\(R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}\\) is the \\(R^2\\) from a regression of \\(x_j\\) onto all of the other predictors. If \\(R^2_{x_j | x_{-j}}\\) is close to one, then collinearity is present, so VIF will be large.\n\nlinear_reg() %&gt;% \n  set_mode(\"regression\") %&gt;% \n  set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;% \n  fit(Balance ~ Age + Rating + Limit, Credit) %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"fit\") %&gt;% \n  car::vif() \n\n       Age     Rating      Limit \n  1.011385 160.668301 160.592880 \n\n\nA regression of balance on age, rating, and limit indicates that the predictors have VIF Values of 1.01, 160.67, 160.59.

    "section": "1.1 Why estimate \\(f\\)?",
    "text": "1.1 Why estimate \\(f\\)?\nTwo reasons: * prediction * inference\nPrediction\nMost of the time we have \\(X\\) but we might not have \\(Y\\). In this setting, since the error term averages to zero, we can predict \\(Y\\) using\n\\[\n\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}X\n\\] (2.2)\nHere \\(\\hat{f}\\) is treated as a black box. We are not concerned with the exact form of \\(\\hat{f}\\), we just want to have accurate predictions of \\(Y\\).\nImagine we have \\(X = (X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p)\\); blood sample characteristics of patients. \\(Y\\) is a variable showing the patient’s risk for a adverse reaction to a drug. We don’t want to give the drug and see the reaction, so we want to predict reactions.\nThe accuracy of our predictions \\(\\hat{Y}\\) of \\(Y\\), depends on two quantities:\n\nreducible error\nGenerally \\(\\hat{f}\\) will not be a perfect estimate for \\(f\\). This inaccuracy will introduce some error, which we call reducible error since we can improve our accuracy of \\(\\hat{f}\\) using the most appropriate statistical leraning method.\nirreducible error\nEven if we estimate \\(f\\) perfectly, our estimated response would take the form \\(\\hat{Y} = f(X)\\); our predictions would still get some error. This is because \\(Y\\) is not just a function of \\(X\\) but also a function of \\(\\epsilon\\), which cannot be predicted by \\(X\\). So the level of \\(\\epsilon\\) would also effect our prediciton accuracy. And we cannot remove this error; thus, irreducible.\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is larger than zero; because \\(\\epsilon\\) may contain some variables we don’t include in our model, but effect \\(Y\\).\n\nInference\nHere we want to understand the way that \\(Y\\) is affected by \\(X\\). In this setting, we wish to estimate \\(f\\) but we are not concerned with predicting. We want to understand the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\); how \\(Y\\) changes as \\(X\\) changes. We don’t treate \\(\\hat{f}\\) as a black box now since we need to know its exact form. In this setting we are interested in answering questions such as\n\nWhich predictors are associated with the response?\nUsually not all predictors are associated with \\(Y\\). We need to identify the important predictors among a large set of possible predictors.\nWhat is the relationship between the response and each predictor?\nSome predictors have positive some negative association with \\(Y\\). Depending on the complexity of \\(f\\), the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X_i\\) may also depend on the values of other predictors(\\(X_j\\)) =&gt; synergy\nCan the relationship between \\(Y\\) and each predictor be adequately summarized using a linear equation, or is the relationship more complicated?\n\nSometimes we are interested with prediction: Identifying individuals who will respond positively to a mailing, based on observations of demographic variables. Here we are not interested with understanding the relationship of demographic variables and response, we just want an accurate model to predict the response using the predictors. This is prediction.\nBut often we are interested to answer questions like: Which media contribute to sales?, Which media generate the biggest boost in sales?, or How much increase in sales is associated with a given increase in TV advertising?. This is inference.\nAnd sometimes we want a combination of both: Values of homes based on crime rate, zoning, distance from a river, air quality, schools, size of houses etc. and How does air quality effect valeus of homes?.\nWe use different models for prediction, inference, or combination of the two.\n\n1.1.1 How Do We Estimate \\(f\\)?\nThere are many linear and non-linaer approaches we will discuss. But generally these models share certain characteristics. Here are they:\n\nWe will always assume that we have observed a set of n different data points. These data points, observations, are called training data; which we will use these observations to train, or teach, our model on how to estimate \\(f\\). Our training data will consist of \\(\\{(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \\dots, (x_n,y_n)\\}\\), where \\(x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\dots, x_{ip})^T\\)\n\nWe want to apply a statistical learning method to the training data to estimate the unknown function \\(f\\). We want to find a function \\(\\hat{f}\\) such that \\(Y \\approx \\hat{f}(X)\\) for any obsrvation \\((X,Y)\\).\nThese statistical learning methods can be charactarized as either parametric or non-parametric.\nParametric Methods\nParametric methods involve a two step model-based approach:\n\nSelect a model =&gt; Make an assumption about the functional form of \\(f\\): is it linear, non linear?\n\nFor example a linear \\(f\\) assumption would yield a linear model\n\\[\n  f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p\n  \\] (2.4)\n\nFit or train the model\n\nAfter we select a model, we need a procedure that uses training data to fit or train the model.\nFor linear model, we need to estimate the parameters of the model (\\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\)). That is we want to find values of these parameters such that \\[\n  Y \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p\n  \\] The most common approach to fitting the model (2.4) is called ordinary least squares. Chapter3. But there are other approaches as well.\nThis model-based approach is called parametric: we estimate \\(f\\) via estimating a set of parameters.\nDisadvantage (potential): model we choose will usually not match the true unknown form of \\(f\\) =&gt; our estimates will be poor. =&gt; solution: choose a flexible model that can fit different possible functional forms for \\(f\\) =&gt; you will need to estimate more parametrs =&gt; overfitting the data.\nNon-parametric Methods\n=&gt; No explicit assumptions about the functional form of \\(f\\). The goal is to get an estimate of \\(f\\) that gets as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly =&gt; advantage over parametric approach: no assumption about the functional form of \\(f\\)–potentially accurately fit a wider range of possible shapes for \\(f\\).\nDisadvantage =&gt; lots of parameters to estimate =&gt; very large of observations required to obtain an accurate estimate for \\(f\\).\n\n\n1.1.2 The Trade-Off Between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability\nSome models are flexible some restrictive; in the sense that they can produce just a small range of functional forms to estimate \\(f\\). Linear regression for instance is a relatively inflexible approach. Other metgods such as thin plate splines (non-parametric) are more flexible because they can generate a much wider range of possible functional forms to estimate \\(f\\).\nWhy would be ever choose to use a more restrictive method instead of a very flexible approach? :\n\nIf we are mainly interested in inference, restrictive models are more interpretable. They give more information about each predictors effect on predicted.\nIf we are mainly interested in prediction, flexible models give better fit. =&gt; but may yield less accurate fits due to overfitting!\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning\nMost statistical learning problems fall into these two categories: supervised or unsupervised.\nIn supervised learning for each observation of the predictor values \\(x_i, i = 1,\\dots, n\\) there is an associated response value \\(y_i\\). We wish to fit a model that relates the response to the predictors with the aims of either accurately predicting the response for future observations (prediction) or better understanding the relationship between the response and the predictors (inference). Linear regression, GAM, boosting, support vector machines operate in the supervised learning domain.\nUnsupervised leraning describes a situtaion in which for every observation \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\) we obser a vector of values \\(x_i\\) but no associated response \\(y_i\\). We cannot use a linear regression model since we dont have \\(y_i\\) values. Here we can seek to understand the relationships between the variables or between the observations; like cluster analysis, or clustering: to assert on the basis of \\(x_i,\\dots,x_n\\) whether the observations fall into relatively distinct groups."

Quantitative varaibles take on numberical values: a person’s age, height, or income, the value of a house, price of stock. Qualitative varaibles take on values n one of \\(K\\) different classes, or categories: aperson’s gender(male or female), the brand of a good (A,B, or C), a person’s race etc.\nWe refer to problems with a quantitative response as regression problems, and probmes with a qualitative response as classification problems. However, the distinction is not clear-cut.\nLeast squares regression is used with a quantitative response, whereas logistic regression is typically used with a qualitative response. Some statistical methods, such as K-nearest negihbors and boosting, can be used in the case of either quantitative or qualitative.\nWe usually select statistical learning methods based on whether the response is quantitative or qualitative: we might use linear regression wjen quantitative and logistic regression when qualitative. But whether the predictors are qualitative or quantitative is usually not that important. Most of the statistical learning methods can be applied regardless of the predictor varible type."

    "section": "1.3 Assessing Model Accuracy",
    "text": "1.3 Assessing Model Accuracy\nThere is no one method that dominates all others over all possible data sets. On a particular data set, one metghod may work best, but some other method may work better on a similar but differet data set. So it is important to assess the model accuracies of the methods.\nHere some ways to asses the model accuracy\n\n1.3.1 Measuring the Quality of Fit\nSo, to evaluate the performance of a statistical learning method on a given data set, we need to measure how well its predictions actually match the observed data.\nIn the regression setting, the most commonly-used measure is the mean squared error (MSE), given by\n\\[\n\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i))^2\n\\]\nMSE will be small if the predicted responses are veryt close to the true responses, and large if predicted and true responses differ substantially on average.\nHere since MSE is computed using the training data it is best to refer it as training MSE. But in general, we do not really care how well the method works on the training data =&gt; we are interested in the accuracy of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously unseen test data.\nImagine: stock price prediction =&gt; we have training and test data =&gt; we already know the stock prices of the past, we dont care about the training data accuracy of the model, we want our model to predict the future prices of stocks best.\nOr we have blood characteristics of diabetes patients. We don’t want our model to explain our existing patient’s classification of diabetes or not, we want our model to predict our future patien’s situation the best.\nMathematically:\nWe fit our statistical learning method on our training observations \\(\\{(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \\dots, (x_n,y_n)\\}\\), and we obtain the estimate \\(\\hat{f}\\). We can then compute \\(\\hat{f}(x_1),\\dots, \\hat{f}(x_n)\\). If these are approximately equal to \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\) then our training MSE will be small. Howeer, we are not interested in whether \\(y_i \\approx \\hat{f}(x_i)\\), we want to know whether \\(\\hat{f}(x_0)\\) is approximately equal to \\(y_0\\), where \\((x_0,y_0)\\) is a previously unseen test obsrevation not used to train the statistical learning method.\nThat is, we want to choose the method that gives the lowest test MSE!.\nSo with our test data we can compute test MSE\n\\[\n\\text{MSE}_{test} =\\frac{1}{n_{test}} \\sum(y_{test_{i}} - \\hat{f}(X_{test_i}))\n\\] (2.6)\nWe want the test MSE to be small as possible. We can compute test MSE via (2.6) if we have test data for different models and select the model with minimum test MSE.\nIf we don’t have a test data, you might think our goal would be to minimize the training MSE since test and training data are colesly related. But no; minimal training MSE doesn’t guarantee minimal training MSE\nUsually as the level of flexibility increases, the curves fit the observed data more closely =&gt; lower training MSE. The level of flexibility is quantified by degrees of freedom. More restricted models have lower degrees of freedom. and usually the training MSE declines as flexibility increases.\n\nAs the flexibility of the statistical learning method increases, we observe a monotone decrease in the training MSE and a \\(U\\)-shape in the test MSE. This is a fundamental property of statistical learning that holds regardless of the particular data set at hand and regardless of the statistical method being used. AS model flexibility increases, training MSE will decrease, but the test MSE may not. When a given method yields a small training MSE but a large test MSE, we are said to be overfitting the data. This happens because our statistical learninig procedure is working too hard to find patterns in the training data, and may be picking up some patterns that are just caused by random change rather than by true properties of the unknown function \\(f\\). When we overfit the trainin data, the test MSE will be very large because the supposed patterns that the method found in the training data simply don’t exist in the test data.\nNote that regardless of whether or not overfitting has occured, we almost always expect the training MSE to be smaller than the test MSE because most statistical learning methods either directly or inderectly seek to mimizie the training MSE. Overfitting refers specifically to the case in which a less flexible model would have yielded a smaller test MSE.\nIn practice, training MSE is computed easily, but estimating test MSE is hard because usually no test data are available. We will learn approaches that can be used in practice to estimate the mininmum test MSE. One important method is cross-validation( Chapter 5), which is a method for estimating test MSE using the training data.\n\n\n1.3.2 The Bias-Variance Trade-Off\nThe U-shape in the test MSE result of two competing properties of statistical learnig methods. The expected test MSE, for a given value \\(x_0\\) can always be decomposed into sum of variance of \\(\\hat{f}(x_0)\\), the squared bias of \\(\\hat{f}(x_0)\\) and the variance of the error terms \\(\\epsilon\\). That is\nThis means that to minimize the expected test error, we need to simultaneously have low variance and low bias. Since variance is always bigger than zero; \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)\\), and \\(\\text{Bias}(\\hat{f}(x_0))\\) are nonnegative. So, the expected test MSE can never lie below \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)\\), the irreducible error from (2.3).\nWhat do we mean by the variance and bias of statistical learning method?\nVarince refers to the amount by which \\(\\hat{f}\\) would change if we estimated it using a different training data set; different training data sets will result in a different \\(\\hat{f}\\). But ideally, \\(\\hat{f}\\) should not vary too much between training sets. If a method has high variance small changes in the training data can result in large changes in \\(\\hat{f}\\).\nFlexible methods have hiher variance, because they fit better to the data points and changing any of the data points may cause the estiamte \\(\\hat{f}\\) to chance considerably. But for example, least squares method is relatively inflexible and has low variance, because mooving any single observation will cause only a small shift in the position of the line.(2.9)\nbias refers to the error that is due to functional form of \\(\\hat{f}\\). In real life, linear relationships are very rare. So performing linear regression will result in some bias in the estimate of \\(f\\). If your \\(f\\) is non-linear performing linear regression on different data sets will not produce an accurate estimate; so linear regression will result in high bias.\nFor example in 2.9 true \\(f\\) is non linear; so linear regression have high bias, low variance. \nIn 2.10 true \\(f\\) is very close to linear, so linaer regression have low bias, low variance.\nGenerally more flexible methods result in less bias.\nAs a general rule, as we use more flexible methods the variance will increase and bias will decrease. The relative rate of change of these two quantities determines whether test MSE increases or decreases. As we increase the flexibility, the bias tends to initially decrease faster than the variance increases =&gt; test MSE declines. However, at some point increasing flexibility has little impact on thebias but starts to significantly increase the variance =&gt; test MSE increases.\n\nFigure 2.12 shows bias and variance effect to the test MSE for different \\(f\\)s. Horizontal dashed line represents \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon)\\), the irreducible error; the red curve test MSE is the sum of squared bias, variance, and variance of irreducible error. In all cases bias decreases as flexibility increaes. However, the optimal flexibility is different for each \\(f\\). In the left panel the bias initially decreaes rapidly, decreasing test MSE. In center panel true \\(f\\) is closer to linear so there is only a small decrease in bias as flexibility increaes, and the test MSE only declines slightly before increasing rapidly as the variance increaes. Right hand panel, as flexibility increaess bias dramatically decreases because true \\(f\\) is very non-linear. There is alsso very little increase in variance as flexibility increases =&gt; tets MSE decreases before increasing.\nThis is called bias-variance trade off. Good test set performance of a method requires low variance as well as low squared bias. This is a trade off because it is easy to obtain a method with extremely low bias but high variance(for instance, drawing a curve that passes through every single training observation, or a method with low variance but high bias(by fitting a horizontal line to the data). Challange is finding a method wihch both the variance and squareed bias are low.\nIn real life, it is not possible to explicitly compute the test MSE, bias, or variance for methods. But we should keep this in mind.\n\n\n1.3.3 The Classification Setting\nSo far we focused on regression setting. Problems such as bias-variance trade of also occurs in classification but in a modificated way because \\(y_i\\) is no longer numerical.\nSuppose that we seek to estiamte \\(f\\) on the basis of training observations \\(\\{(x_1,y_1), \\dots, (x_n,y_n)\\}\\) where now \\(y_1,\\dots, y_n\\) are qualitative.\nWe need to quantify the accuracy of our estimate \\(\\hat{f}\\). We can use the training error rate, the proportion of mistakes that are made if we apply our estimate \\(\\hat{f}\\) to the training observations:\n\\[\n\\text{error rate}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y_i})\n\\] (2.8)\n\\(\\hat{y_i}\\) is the predicted class label for the \\(i\\)th observation using \\(\\hat{f}\\). \\(I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y_i})\\) is an indicator variable that equals 1 if \\(y_i \\neq \\hat{y_i}\\) and zero if \\({y_i = \\hat{y_i}}\\). If \\(I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y_i}) = 0\\) then \\(i\\)th observation was classified correctly, otherwise it was misclassified. So (2.8) computes the fraction of incorrect classifications.\n(2.8) is training error. But as the regression setting we are more interested in test error rate. The test error rate associated with a set of test observations of the form\n\\[\n\\text{error rate}_{test} = \\frac{1}{n_{test}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{test}}(I(y_{test_i} \\neq \\hat{y}_{test_i}))\n\\] (2.9)\nA good classifier is one for which the test error is smallest.\nThe Bayes Classifier\nWe can minimize test error rate by a very simple classifier that assigns each observation to the most likely class, given its predictor values. In other words, we should simply assign a test observation with predictor vector \\(x_0\\) to the class \\(j\\) for which\n\\[\nPr(Y = j | X = x_0)\n\\] (2.10)\nis largest. This is conditional probability: it is the probabilty that \\(Y=j\\) given the observed predictor vector \\(x_0\\). This classifier is called Bayes classifier.\nIn a two-class problem where there are only two possible response values, class 1 or class2, the Bayes classifier corresponds to predicting class one if \\(Pr(Y=1 | X = x_0) &gt; 0.5\\), and class two otherwise.\nImagine having \\(X = (X_1, X_2)\\). For each value of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) there will be a different probability of the response being class 1 or 2. For \\(Pr(Y=class1 | X = (X_2,X_2)) &gt; 0.5\\) and \\(Pr(Y=class2 | X = (X_1,X_2))\\).\nThe Bayes classifier produces the lowest possible test error rate, called the Bayes error rate. Since the Bayes classifer will always choose the class for which \\(Pr(Y = j | X = x_0)\\) is largest, the error rate at \\(X=x_0\\) will be \\(1-\\max_jPr(Y =j | X = x_0)\\). In general, the overall Bayes error rate is given by\n\\[\n\\text{Bayes error rate} = 1 - E(\\max_jPr(Y =j | X))\n\\] (2.11)\nwhere the expectation averages the probabilty over all possible values of X. The Bayes eror rate is analogous to the irreducible eror.\nK-Nearest Neighbors\nIn theory we always want to predict qualitative responses using the Bayes classifier. But for real data, we do not know the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), and so computing the Bayes classfier is impossible. So Bayes classifier is like a gold standard to compare other methods.\nMany approaches attemp to estiamte the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), and then classify a given observation to the class with highest estimated probability. One of them is K-nearest neighbors(KNN) classfier.\nGiven a positive integer K and a test observation \\(x_0\\), the KNN clasffier first identifies the K points in the training data that are closest to \\(x_0\\), represented by \\(N_0\\). It then esitmates the conditional probability for class j as the fraction points in \\(N_0\\) whose response values equal to \\(j\\).\n\\[\nPr(Y = j | X = x_0) = \\frac{1}{K}\\sum_{i \\in N_0}I(y_i=j)\n\\] (2.12)\nFinally, KNN applies Bayes rule and classifies the test observation \\(x_0\\) to the class with the largest probability.\n\nFigure 2.14 provides an illustrative example of the KNN approach. Left panel =&gt; Our goal is to make prediction for the black cross point. When \\(K=3\\) KNN will identify the 3 oservations that are closest to the cross. There are two blue and one orange points; \\(Pr(Y=orange | X = x_{cross}) = 1/3\\), and \\(Pr(Y=blue | X = x_{cross}) = 2/3\\) =&gt; KNN will predict that the black cross belongs to the blue class.\nThe choice of K is very important. as K increases flexibility decreases =&gt; high bias, but low variance.\nJust like in regression setting there is not a strong relationship between the training error rate and the test error rate.\n\nas in the regression setting, the training error rate consistently declines as the flexibility(\\(1/K\\)) increases. However, the test error rate again have a characteristic U-shape.\nIn both regression and classification settings, choosing the correct level of flexibility is critical. The bias-variance tradeoff =&gt; U-shape in the test error, can make this a difficult task."
